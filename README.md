# Gopher Clients
Archive of various Gopher clients for a variety of platforms.
These old clients are increasingly difficult to find, with old FTP servers
being shutdown, as universities and colleges "upgrade" their websites. 

All items here are supplied as is. If you don't want your client included here
please let me know on pgodwin@gmail.com.

## Archives
See [archives](/archives) for original sources of Gopher resources. 
These are basically dumps of old resources as I've found as I've gone along. 

 * [boombox](/archives/boombox) - an archive of boombox.micro.umn.edu - this was the University of Minnesota's (the creators of Gopher) distribution point for Gopher resources - seemingly offline. 
 * [iubio.bio.indiana.edu.au](/archives/iubio.bio.indiana.edu/) - an archivie of the gopher directory of Biology Department of the Indiana University of Bloomington. Should still be online at [http://iubioarchive.bio.net/soft/util/gopher/]
 * [offbeatinternet](/archives/offbeatinternet) - from [https://www.jumpjet.info/Offbeat-Internet/Gopher/archive.htm] a collection of Gopher clients - still online today.
