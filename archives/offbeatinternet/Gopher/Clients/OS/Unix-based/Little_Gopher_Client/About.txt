Little Gopher Client
(ver 1.0)
Freeware


The Little Gopher Client is a 64-bit Linux/X11 
application that was written in Free Pascal 
and Lazarus.  It was mainly made to browse and 
read articles in conventional gopherspace (no 
Gopher+), and it currently only supports menus 
and text content (no downloads, images, or queries).  

The biggest feature it has compared to most other 
Gopher clients is the browser sidebar which maps 
the gopherspace as you go, taking advantage of 
Gopher's hierarchical nature.  Or at least it tries 
to, since many modern gopherholes today treat Gopher 
menus as "HTTP-lite", using Gopher as a hierarchial 
frontend for HTTP back links and such.  Still, it 
helps to navigate faster than without it.
