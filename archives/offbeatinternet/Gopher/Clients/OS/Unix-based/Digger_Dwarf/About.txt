Freeware


Digger Dwarf is a console-based gopher client for Linux.
It is entirely written in FreeBASIC, and uses the ChiSock 
library for networking.


Usage:
ddwarf [url [--saveto=file]] [--proxy=proxyaddr [--proxyport=xx] [--proxyauth=login:pass]]

If you call DDwarf without any parameter, then it will simply 
open its browsing window, and let you to enter any URL of your 
choice. If called with a URL parameter, it will start and 
immediately open the specified URL (if possible). If you add 
the "--saveto=" parameter, then DDwarf will load the given URL, 
dump its content to the specified file, and quit.
