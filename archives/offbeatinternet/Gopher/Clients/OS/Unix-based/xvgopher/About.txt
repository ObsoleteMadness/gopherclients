xvgopher
(ver 1.0pre)
Freeware


Xvgopher is a Gopher client tested on SunOS 4.x.  It requires XView.  
The software is offered in two statically linked executables:

XVGOPHER.NIS = This one is linked with the standard Sun NIS library.  
		Use this if you do NOT have a  /etc/resolv.conf

XVGOPHER.RES = This one is linked with libresolv.a.  Use this if you DO
		have  /etc/resolv.conf


Both programs will try to contact a local host named 'gopher' at port 
70.  You can change this on the command line.  Known problems with this
prerelease are:

	- No bookmarks!
	- The cut and paste in the action preferences do not work.
	- The directory filter doesn't filter on dates or types.
