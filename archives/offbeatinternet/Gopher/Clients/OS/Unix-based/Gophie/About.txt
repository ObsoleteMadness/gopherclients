Gophie
(ver 1.1)
Freeware


Gophie is a Gopher Browser for Linux written in 
Java.  Gophie allows you to navigate Gopherspace, 
read text, view images, and download files with the 
integrated download manager.

The Linux package is simply a tar.gz-archive with an 
executable. The executable is a bash-file with the 
JAR-file attached.  You can either double-click the 
executable named "Gophie" or launch it from the 
terminal of your choice.  If you wish to have Gophie 
present wherever you need it in your system, just 
copy the executable file into your "/usr/bin"-directory.
