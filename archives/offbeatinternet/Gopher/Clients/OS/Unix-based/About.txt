There are numerous version of Unix-based software.  Popular older
varients are SunOS, HP-UX, and IRIX.  Popular newer varients are Linux 
and Macintosh OSX.  There are also several interfaces such as CURSES 
and X-windows.  Some versions may require extra tools, such as Python.  

The software listed here is all Unix-based.  However not all may
work on your particular flavor of Unix.  You may have to modify the 
source code before you compile.  

As I no longer operate a Unix-based system, I am unable to confirm the 
suitability of any of this software.  Use at your own risk.  


==========

If anyone knows where I can obtain more un-corrupted versions of 
GopherVR for Unix (I already have the IRIX version of GopherVR), 
it would be most helpful.  There were at least 7 variants;
for AIX, Alpha-OSF, IRIX, Lunix, Solaris (both for Sparc and i386 
processors), and SunOS.  Version numbering had reached at least 0.2.
