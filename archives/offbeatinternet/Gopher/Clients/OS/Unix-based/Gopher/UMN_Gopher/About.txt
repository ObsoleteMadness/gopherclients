UMN Gopher
(ver 2.3.1)
Freeware


This is the University of Minnesota's Internet Gopher Server (gopherd)
and Gopher+ Curses Client for UNIX machines.  A client for VMS is also 
included in the package.  

The University of Minnesota no longer develops this software.  The source 
code has been taken over by John Goerzen, the owner of quux.org, who has 
continued development on his own (see: "Gopher") for use under "debian".


CAUTION: UMN Gopher has trouble accessing the root directory of some 
Gopher servers (especially GopherS), and will complain that there is 
"Nothing available." in the servers root directory.  You can force 
retrieval of the root menu by using the command: 
$ gopher -p "" server.tld


=====

Note that I am unable to separate out the "VMS" client from the other 
Unix-based software mixed in with this file.
