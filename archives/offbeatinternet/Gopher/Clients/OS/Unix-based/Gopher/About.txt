Gopher
(ver 3.0.11)
Freeware


The University of Minnesota no longer develops "Gopher", its Gopher+ Curses 
Client for UNIX machines.  The source code has been taken over by John Goerzen, 
the owner of quux.org, who has continued to develop Gopher on his own for use 
under "debian" unix.  

This is the most recent version of Gopher.  The last official UMN version 
of Gopher (now called "UMN Gopher") was version 2.3.1.  


CAUTION: This client improperly tries to access standard Gopher(0) servers 
as if they were Gopher(+) servers, and therefore the root directory of many 
Gopher servers will appear empty to this client.  Note that this is the 
only client known to have this bug.
