sgopher
(ver 0.3)
Freeware


Sgopher is a simple gopher client intended for VMS, IRIX, Ultrix, AIX,
and Solaris.  It was designed so that anyone with a telnet program 
could run a gopher client.  Item Types that the software can handle are
limited to Index, Text, and Directories (which means that this software
is essentially just a Gopher based text viewer).

Note that I am unable to separate out the "Wollongong VMS" client from 
the other Unix-based software mixed in with this file.
