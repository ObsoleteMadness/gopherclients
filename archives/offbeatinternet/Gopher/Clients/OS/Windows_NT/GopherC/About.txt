GopherC
(ver 3.2.0.0)
Abandonware


GopherC is a Gopher+ Client written for Windows NT 3.1.  Unlike 
most other Gopher Clients, you can connect to Servers on any Port.  

GopherC was bundled by Beame & Whiteside into their commercial 
BW-Connect NFS software package.  This Client does not require 
installing, as it will run directly from a directory containing the 
file "gophercw.exe".  You must have a functional Internet connection 
however, and the path must find the DLL file "CTL3D32.DLL".

GopherC can be run stand-alone under Win2k, but it will complain 
that "NFS not loaded". Do -NOT- close this "License Problem" dialog 
box, or GopherC will shut down.  

GopherC uses two INI files, "GOPHERC.INI" and "BWAPPS.INI", which 
it will create in the same directory as contains "gophercw.exe".  
The Help file, which should reside in the same directory as 
"gophercw.exe", is "wingoph.hlp" (note that like all Help files, 
"wingoph.hlp" will create its own hidden file, "WINGOPH.GID", in 
the same directory as "wingoph.hlp").  

The file "bwaudio.exe" is a supplementary audio player for GopherC.

Although preconfigured for the B&W Telnet Client "BW220W.EXE",
you can change the configuration to point to your own Telnet Client. 



NOTE:
Because GopherC was never intended to run stand-alone, and because it
was originally sold as commercial software (although now abandoned), 
this software is -NOT- a good choice for your primary Gopher Client.
However, it is a Gopher Plus Client, and it can view Gopher Servers
running on Ports other than 70; so it does have a limited nich as
a testing Client.
