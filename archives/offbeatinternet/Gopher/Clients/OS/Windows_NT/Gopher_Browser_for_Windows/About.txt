Gopher Browser for Windows
(ver 1.2)
Freeware


Gopher Browser for Windows is a 32-bit Windows 
application that does NOT require installation.  
Simply place it in the folder that you wish to 
run it from, and launch the EXE.

Caution: If you wish to run the SetHandler.exe 
program from within the Browser (shoudn't we be 
calling a Gopher protocol Browser a "Burrower"?), 
it needs to reside in the same directory as the 
Browser.  Note that SetHandlers only function is 
to (only once required, unless it is later changed) 
tell the registry that Gopher Browser for Windows 
is the default handler for Gopher protocol URLs.  

The Browser requires that .NET Runtime be 
installed on the computer.  I am including a 
complimentary version of .NET Runtime (version 
2.0 sp2), which will install on Windows 2000.  

.NET Runtime = NetFx20SP2_x86.zip
