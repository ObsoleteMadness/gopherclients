GopherVR for MacOS X
(ver 0.5.1)
Freeware


GopherVR is a 3-D virtual reality interface to Gopherspace, for 
MacOS X versions 10.4 through 10.11 (PowerPC or Intel).  GopherVR   
allows you to "walk around a Gopher server", and get a graphic view 
of its contents using a simple VR-type world.  

GopherVR was originally released unfinished (in a version for Motif-
based X11), then promptly abandoned.  This newer version of GopherVR 
is based on the original source code, and has been updated with some 
additional features and some critical bug fixes.  It contains a 
launcher that maintains a Dock icon, and autostarts X11.  Place the 
program into your /Applications folder.

==========

NOTE: Running GopherVR on a Macintosh running OS X version 10.4 or above 
requires that you first install "X11" (which should already be on the 
system) and "OpenMotif" (which you possibly do not have).  I am offering 
copies of OpenMotif-Mac (ver 2.1.32), which you can download if necessary:

OpenMotif-Mac_10-4_2-1-dmg.zip = For PowerPC or Intel Mac OS X version 10.4.
OpenMotif-Mac_10-5_2-1-dmg.zip = For Mac OS X versions 10.5 - 10.11.

This modified distribution of IST OpenMotif 2.1.32 runs from "Applications".   
It interfaces correctly with SIP, and is compatible with a PowerPC or i386. 
The Zip file includes all binaries, libraries, and development headers.

To install, open the disk image and drag the folder to /Applications. 
Do not change any names or relative paths.
