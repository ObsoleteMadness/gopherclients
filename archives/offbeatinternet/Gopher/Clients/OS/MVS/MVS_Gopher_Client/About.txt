MVS Gopher Client and Server
(ver 3r1)
Freeware


These distribution files contain both a Gopher client and Gopher server 
for the IBM MVS (MVS/XA) mainframe operating system (because I have no
ability to separate the client from the server).  


This software is offered in two variants:

 If you have a C compiler, then use.... gopher.ggmvs.distrib.cntl.v3r1
 If you don't have a C compiler, use... gopher.ggmvs.distobj.cntl.v3r1
