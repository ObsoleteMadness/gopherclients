Review of Gopher Client (initial release):
------------------------------------------


I've tested it out some.  It's functional, but could certainly use work.  

It has no back button, you have to use a drop down history menu to go back.  
It doesn't handle images.  Where firefox shows a directory folder, this 
client shows "[dir]" and like the good-old consol gopher you have to 
download any image links.  

With a little work it looks like it could grow into a nice little 
browser though.
