WSGopher32

Reviewed 7/29/08 by: Avery M.


This client presents gophers in an interesting combination of a tree
layout and simple display. Folders are extracted from the linear
display and put into the tree, but the surrounding information text
isn't. Because i-text is used so heavily on modern Gophers, this makes
for a disjointed reading. h-type links are not properly followed
(they're downloaded instead).
