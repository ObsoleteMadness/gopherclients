WSGopher32
(ver 2.0)
Abandonware


Written by Lockheed Martin Idaho Technologies for the Idaho National 
Engineering Laboratory.  You must run the setup program 
"wsgopher20.exe" to install the software.  By default, the program 
installs in the "C:\Program Files\WSGopher32" directory (program 
settings are stored in the "WSGOPHER.INI" file located here).  

WSGopher32 features a  hierarchical interface which shows a structured 
hierarchy of information.  Navigation is accomplished by simply 
selecting the appropriate location in a directory tree.

Configuration options are consolidated into a property page dialog to 
make configuration easier.  The main gopher window can be split into 
either two or three views, making navigation easier.  Personal 
bookmarks are organizable and accessable from the main gopher window.  


P.S., Don't try to register the software, as Lockheed Martin has 
abandoned the software and will NOT accept your money.
