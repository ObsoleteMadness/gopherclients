Gopherus
(ver 1.0a)
Freeware


This is a 32-bit Windows port of the Gopherus console-mode 
gopher client for DOS. It provides a classic text interface 
to the gopherspace. 

This port is essentially the same as the DOS version, only 
it uses the file "SDL.dll" to emulate a pseudo terminal.  

There is NO installer.  Just place the executable and dll 
in a directory of your choice and run the program from there.  
Downloads default to the directory you run the program from. 
To uninstall, just delete the directory you created.
