Gophie
(ver 1.1)
Freeware


Gophie is a Gopher Browser for Windows written in 
Java.  Gophie allows you to navigate Gopherspace, 
read text, view images, and download files with the 
integrated download manager.

Gopher does NOT require installation.  Simply place 
it in the folder that you wish to run it from, and 
launch the EXE.  

The Browser requires that a Java Runtime Environment 
of version 8 or higher be installed on the computer.  
I am including a complimentary 32-bit version of JRE 
(version 8, update 151), which will install on Windows XP.  

JRE 8 = Java_Runtime_Environment_(32bit)_v8_Update_151.zip
