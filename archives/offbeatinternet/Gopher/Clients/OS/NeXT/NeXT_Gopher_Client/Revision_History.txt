Version 1.12 - changes by Paul Lindner lindner@boombox.micro.umn.edu

    Fixed the client so that it can work with the new index-server protocol change.

    Upped the size of some data structures so that it can better deal with WAIS gateways.


Version 1.11 - changes by Paul Lindner lindner@boombox.micro.umn.edu

    Made some cosmetic changes.  Spiffed up some of the panels.  Made
them look pretty.

    Added an Item Type Field in the Item info panel.

    Fixed the Help menu item to better reflect reality.

    Fixed up the highlighting of search terms.  Also added a Find menu
item so the user can find the relevant portions of the document, given
the search string.  (I still need to implement a find previous
though.)


Version 1.1  - changes by David Lacey dlacey@umaxc.weeg.uiowa.edu

   Added a Stuart Speaker interface so that Stuart could be messaged rather than just Terminal when a Telnet session was called.  Also added a preferences item for this.  Stuart is better than Terminal because, unlike terminal, Stuart doesn't start a new app each time you fire up a telnet session.

   Added an alert box to show you the login to use when you do a telnet and a login was specified by the server.

   Added a speaker to Rex Pruess's Ph program to handle CSO Nameservers.

   Fixed the initial menu negotiation -- Gopher used to send two \n\r sequences to the server causing it to die under some conditions (noticeably on a SLIP link)

   Changed the window from 3 small panes to 2 larger panes.

   Enlarged the Courier font used to represent the Telnet sessions -- better legibility

   Changed the Defaults database to look for "Gopher" rather than "UST_Gopher" to be more consistent with the NeXT defaults interface.

   Added two new response code handlers:
   	Type 'R' for rlogin.  Useful because the system can negotiate the login for the user transparently rather than having to give the user an alert box telling them what to type.
	Type 'T' for tn3270 sessions.  Useful for all those ugly blue boxes that just won't go away...

   Changed default port from 150 to 70.


Gopher 1.0c release notes

Fixed an annoying problem with the index popup.  Hitting the close button would cause the program to hang.

Added a spiffy icon.


Gopher 1.0b2 release notes

Fixed a minor but annoying bug : I forgot to switch the default shell
for Terminal to what it was.


Gopher 1.0b release notes

This is the 1.0 release of my Gopher client. It is by no means perfect,
but I am leaving the country and I wanted to release something that
worked. The main changes from 0.9b :

- help text has been beefed up
- main window uses a SplitView so you can resize the Browser and the Text
- allows telnet connections (but in a rather ugly way).
- allows sounds to be played. To do so, however, you must first install the "play" program.
