UMN Gopher
(ver 2.3.1)
Freeware


This is the University of Minnesota's Internet Gopher Server (gopherd)
and Gopher+ Curses Client for UNIX machines.  A client for VMS is also 
included in the package.  


CAUTION: UMN Gopher has trouble accessing the root directory of some 
Gopher servers (especially GopherS), and will complain that there is 
"Nothing available." in the servers root directory.  You can force 
retrieval of the root menu by using the command: 
$ gopher -p "" server.tld


=====

Note that I am unable to separate out the VMS client from the other 
"Unix-based" software mixed in with this file.
