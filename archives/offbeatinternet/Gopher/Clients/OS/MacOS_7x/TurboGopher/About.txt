TurboGopher
(ver 2.0.3)
Freeware


TurboGopher is a MDI (Multiple Document Inferface).  
TurboGopher is one of the fastest, most powerful Gopher clients 
available on any platform, from the very people who created Gophering. 
It's multithreaded, and comes with a copy of Thread Manager 2.1 just in 
case you need it. There are other gopher programs out there, but they 
all stopped being developed a long time ago. TurboGopher is really the 
only viable choice--and that's not a bad thing!


Warning: TurboGopher will NOT work on MacOS version 10.4.4 or higher for 
Intel processors, or any version of MacOS 10.5 or higher.
