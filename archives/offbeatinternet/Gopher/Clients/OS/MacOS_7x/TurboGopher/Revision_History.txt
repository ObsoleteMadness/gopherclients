TurboGopher 2.0b1:
November 15, 1994

This version of TurboGopher marks the start of our move toward a
component architecture for Internet access tools  as well as adding
PowerPC native mode support and several significant  new features.

Why use this version?

1.  Runs native on both 68K Macs and PowerMacs.
2.  Displays and resolves Gopher URLs and calls helper 
    applications to resolve URLs for other access methods.
    Turbogopher currently can call Anarchie (for FTP), NewsWatcher 
    (for NNTP), MacWeb (for http). TurboGopher also calls helper 
    applications to render documents (for instance, Adobe Acrobat 
    Exchange or Acrobat Reader for PDF documents, MacWeb for HTML
    documents), and calls Ph to handle ph/qi directory queries.
3.  TurboGopher can be called by other applications using get URL 
    and Fetch URL appleevents; this is used by the InternetLink 
    plugin in Acrobat Exchange to resolve URLs embedded in Acrobat
    PDF documents and by NewsWatcher for resolving Gopher URLs.
4.  Cut-Copy-Paste any gopher items which makes it easy to arrange
    (and rearrange) your gopher bookmarks.
5.  Document/Directory size only limited by available memory. You can
    view documents larger then 32K without saving the document to disk.
6.  Many other bugfixes and enhancements...

Why would you not use this version?
    You are running System 6 on your Mac.

Prerequisites:
    System 7 required.
    Thread Manager required.
    MacTCP required.
    (All three come standard with System 7.5)

Why a component architecture for network applications?
------------------------------------------------------

Internet protocols are not static, but continue to change and
evolve. This makes it difficult to adequately support several
protocols in a single monolithic application. At the same time, 
non-Internet applications (such as word processors, page 
description languages, spreadsheets, etc.) are starting to 
incorporate references to network resources via URLs. Expecting 
every application to contain Internet client software 
to resolve URLs and also track ongoing changes in network 
protocols is unrealistic. Instead, a suite of optimized network 
access components that can be called by other programs to resolve 
URLs makes it easier to add internet awareness to non-Internet 
applications (for instance Adobe PDF documents) and make it 
easier to write and maintain Internet access components.

A group of Macintosh developers including
     Peter Lewis            (Anarchie)
     John Norstad           (Ph, NewsWatcher)
     Steve Dorner           (Eudora) 
     Internet Gopher team   (Turbogopher, POPmail, InternetLink)
     John Hardin            (MacWeb)
have defined and implemented an AppleEvent suite that Macintosh 
network applications can use to call each other to fetch resources 
pointed to by IETF-standard URLs. This approach makes it easy to 
add URL support to most any application since you can call 
appropriate helper application to handle the URL. So... this 
version of TurboGopher functions as a standalone gopher client and 
it can be called by other applications that want to resolve a Gopher 
URL. Turbogopher also calls other applications to resolve ftp, 
nntp, and http URLs, so you don't have to settle for a monolithic
application with mediocre support for several protocols anymore.
