Rice CMS Gopher Client and Server
(ver 2.4.2)
Freeware


The Rice Gopher was developed by Rick Troth of Rice University, Texas. 
The distribution file contains both a Gopher client and Gopher server 
for the IBM CMS (VM/CMS) mainframe operating system (because I have no
ability to separate the client from the server).


The server is based on RXSOCKET (requires TCP/IP version 2) and 
CMS Pipelines.
