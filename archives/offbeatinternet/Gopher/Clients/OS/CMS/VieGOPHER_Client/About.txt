VieGOPHER Client and Server
(ver ?)
Freeware


VieGOPHER was developed by Gerhard Gonter.  The distribution file 
contains both a Gopher client and Gopher server for the IBM CMS (VM/CMS)
mainframe operating system (because I have no ability to separate the
client from the server).


The client needs either REXTCPIP or RXSOCKET for network transport 
and XEDIT for the user interface.

The server is based on REXTCPIP (requires TCP/IP version 1 or 2).
