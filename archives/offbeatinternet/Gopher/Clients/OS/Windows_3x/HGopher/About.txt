HGopher
(ver 2.4)
Freeware


HGopher is a SDI (Single Document Inferface) window with back/forward buttons. 
There is no installer.  All files are self-contained within the programs
own directory (which can be anywhere and named anything).  


Note:
The included bookmark page has many dead links.  The file where these 
bookmarks are stored is a simple (modifiable) text file called "DEFAULT.GBM".
