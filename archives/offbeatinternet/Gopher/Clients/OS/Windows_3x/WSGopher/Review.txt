WSGOPHER is a widely used and well recommended Windows client program 
from Dave Brooks. It is commonly found as WSG-11.ZIP. Although this 
program has been around for a while, it tends to break WINSOCK packages.
You have to use one of the Beta test versions of Trumpet 1.0B to get 
anything, and make sure to put the latest maintenance on any other 
WINSOCK package. 

WSGOPHER presents Gopherspace as a sequence of cascading menus nested 
within the application window. Following current Windows practice, 
there is a toolbar with options to do things like save, print, and copy 
to the clipboard. The type of each item is represented by a small icon 
that allows the menus to be displayed quite compactly. 

To support several menus simultaneously will require extra memory. The 
one disadvantage of WSGOPHER is that it needs a lot of RAM (an 8 meg 
machine is required, a 12 meg machine is nicer). 

WSGOPHER is configured through the Configure drop down menus. This 
allows the user to select an initial home menu, set fonts, determine 
the programs that view special data types, and select Gopher+ 
preferences.

This rather massive panel tells WSGOPHER to prefer compressed audio 
(ulaw) over uncompressed (wav). Similarly JPEG files are more 
aggressively compressed (especially for photographs) than GIF images. 
A user would add from the right hand side data types which the client 
computer can view ("Microsoft-word" for example) and would order them 
by preference (Word before PostScript).
