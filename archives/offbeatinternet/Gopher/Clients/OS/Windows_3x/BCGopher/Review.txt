BCGOPHER from Boston College offers less function than WSGOPHER. The 
big icons take up more space and make the menus stretch out. Only one 
menu is presented at a time, and the user must exit from a lower level 
menu to go back and make another selection from a previous menu. 

BCGOPHER is simple to use and configure, but WSGOPHER appears to be a 
more attractive choice now, unless it breaks your WINSOCK package.
