Gopher for Windows

Reviewed 7/29/08 by: Avery M.


This is a pretty good MDI version of what is essentially a terminal
Gopher client. You can keep multiple menus and text documents open
within the MDI, and ASCII art shows up correctly. However, compared to
tabbed browsing it's kind of a pain to organize.
