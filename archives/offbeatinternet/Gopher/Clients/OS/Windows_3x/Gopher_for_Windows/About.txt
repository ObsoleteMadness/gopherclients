Gopher for Windows
(ver 2.2)
Freeware


One of the earliest Windows Gopher Clients. Selectors are displayed 
DOS-like using letters rather than icons, making navigation difficult. 
If the program does not recognize a file type, rather than display it 
with a "???" icon, it instead does not display the file at all (a very 
bad design flaw, as this means that some full directories can appear 
totally devoid of files). Software also adds a "wgopher.ini" file to 
the 'windows' directory on your hard drive.
