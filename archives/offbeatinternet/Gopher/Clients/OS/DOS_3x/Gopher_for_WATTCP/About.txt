Internet Gopher Information Client for DOS WATTCP
(ver 1.01)
Freeware


This Gopher client is a modification of the UGOPHER Curses based DOS
Gopher client, to make it work with WATTCP.  In many ways it is a 
rather primitive Gopher client, but on the other hand, it allows you 
to use external file viewers (see the "readme.txt" file, which is a
description of the program taken from FDISK.COM).  

To start this program, you need to type "GOPHER -B".  Before starting
however, you need to take a text editor and modify the WATTCP file with
your TCP/IP information (or replace it with your existing WATTCP file).

You will also need to modify the bookmark file "_GOPHER.RC", as most of
the bookmarks are to servers that no longer exist (the program uses 
the bookmark file to begin its Gopher surfing).  I suggest adding a
bookmark to either "gopher.floodgap.com" and/or "home.jumpjet.info".
CAUTION: Replacing the FIRST bookmark entry in the bookmark file MAY 
cause the client to crash (I don't know why, but it did so on my 
computer).  Try at first just adding the links at the bottom of the 
bookmark file (use the PageUp/PageDown keys to see all the listings).

The bookmark file is also where information such as the path to the
temporary directory and external program viewers are located (and you
will need to modify these to match your individual computer setup).
