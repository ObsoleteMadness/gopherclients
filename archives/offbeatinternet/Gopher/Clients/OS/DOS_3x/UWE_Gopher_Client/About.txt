UWE Gopher Client
(ver 0.89)
Freeware


This DOS Gopher Client was written by the University of the West of 
England.  It requires "Lan Workplace for DOS" (to provide TCP/IP).  You
must configure the "GOPHER.CFG" file with your SocksServer information.

I do not have Lan Workplace, so I was unable to test this Client.
