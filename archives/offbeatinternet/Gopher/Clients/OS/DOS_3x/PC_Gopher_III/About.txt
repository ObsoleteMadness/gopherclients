PC Gopher III
(ver 1.1.2)
Freeware


PC Gopher III is a standard Gopher (not Gopher+) Client for Pure DOS.  
It uses a TUI (Textual User Interface) to display Gopher information.  
This software requires a NIC using a WATTCP packet driver.  You must 
configure the "GOPHER.INI" file with both your Path and IP Address 
information.


NOTE: The executables have been patched to fix a Runtime200 error.
