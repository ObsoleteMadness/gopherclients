Internet Gopher Curses Client
(ver ?)
Freeware


This is UGopher, a Curses based DOS Gopher client written by the 
University of Texas Health Science Center.  It requires, a commercial 
tcp/ip stack such as PC/TCP, Lan Workplace for DOS, or PCNFS.

This program should be started with a bookmark file by typing 
"GOPHER -B" (the bookmark file should be called "_GOPHER.RC").  This is
because the Mother Gopher no longer exists, and cannot be used as the 
default root gopher server.  I suggest adding a bookmark pointing to 
either "gopher.floodgap.com" and/or "home.jumpjet.info".

UGopher was ported to work with WATTCP (see the selector "Gopher for
WATTCP").  View the documentation that comes with that ported client, 
for a more detailed understanding of UGopher.


I do NOT have a commercial tcp/ip stack, so I could not test this 
program.  It should be working properly however.
