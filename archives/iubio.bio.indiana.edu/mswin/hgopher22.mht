	       ANNOUNCING THE AVAILABILITY OF HGOPHER Beta 2.2
                              and HNGOPHER Beta 2.2

	                A Gopher+ Client For Windows 3.1 

PLEASE NOTE: in order to work this version must have hgopher.ini (part of the zip
file) installed in your WINDOWS DIRECTORY (this was not made very clear in the
documentation and has caused some early testers problems - I guess its a bug as well!)

Changes since Beta 1.0

	* Product is now a Gopher+ client.
            I believe most if not all gopher+ related features are
             supported including 
		* Alternative views
                * Abstracts
                * Admin information
                * Ask processing

        * HGopher now supports a large and extensible number of viewers
          both for gopher+ and gopher0 servers

        * Alternative view preference selection
          Based on machine; view type; size and language

        * Windows interface re-vamped with  bitmaps and such

        * Gopher+ book mark support

        * On Line Help

        * Many fixes and changes based on user feed back

        * Support for all known (to me) gopher0 base types 
          (including gif and cso)


NOTE: CSO fan's I should qualify that last statement - HGopher will recognize
      a CSO item and spawn off a viewer of your choice with parameters of your
      choice -- Unfortunately there is no CSO application for windows that I
      know about  -- This is the next thing I am going to write - hopefully should 
      not take long.

Requirements
	
    WINSOCK VERSION

	* MS Windows 3.1  (not tested with Windows 3.0)
	  Or Windows NT.
	* Winsock DLL and TCP/IP+Packet support layer.

    PC NFS VERSION
	
	* MS Windows 3.1 (not tested with Windows 3.0)
	* PC NFS Version 4 or version 5 (may work with other versions)

Installation

	Available for ANON FTP from lister.cc.ic.ac.uk
        
	Change to directory pub/wingopher and collect one of the files

	hgopher2.2.zip   [Winsock Version]      (Binary mode required)
	hngopher2.2.zip  [Sun PC NFS Version]   (Binary mode required)


        Unzip the package you have chosen to get 
        hgopher.exe / hngopher.exe
        hgopher.hlp
        hgopher.ini
        readme.txt

        Then read the readme.txt.


        Install these files in your windows directory.
        ( well infact only HGOPHER.INI HAS to be installed there)

	You should also be able to get this product
        from the following archives

	sunsite.unc.edu:<somewhere>
        microdyne.com:/pub/winsock/apps
        boombox.micro.umn.edu:/pub/gopher/Windows
        ftp.york.ac.uk:<somewhere>

        But make sure that you are getting the new 2.2 version (ie hgopher2.2.zip)



*************************** Latest Breaking News ****************************
Please note the following, which is not included in any other documentation

1) It is important to install the hgopher.ini file in your windows directory
   You can install HGopher and Help where you like but hgopher.ini MUST go
   in the default windows directory.

2) Beta 2.2 may have a problem with Gopher+ index items. I am not sure what 
   view type these should be as I'd never seen one until just now. I presumed
   it would be application/gopher-index or application/gopher+-index But maybe
   not (any one got an idea).

3) When talking to gopher+ servers that don't follow the MIME compatible
   view types (eg use Directory rather than application/gopher-menu) there
   is an error in the hgopher.ini file


   replace all occurrences of

	Internal-directory   with internal-directory   (Change in case)
        Internal-index       with internal-index       (change in case)
