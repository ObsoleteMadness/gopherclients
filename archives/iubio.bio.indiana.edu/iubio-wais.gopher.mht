Getting wais to work with gopher requires careful attention to
the sparse details in the gopher documentation.  I would rewrite
some of this if it were my code, as many people stumble on setting this
up, and it is very common to for me and others to get questions
about this.

First get wais working on your system.  Use waisindex and 
waissearch with the default wais-sources/* files to be sure
the wais stuff is working.  In my distribution there is a
wais-sources/test index with some animals and colors.
For instance, in my wais/ folder after making the files, I
test like this:

bin/waissearch -d wais-sources/test red and rooster


You must be very careful with pathnames, as wais uses full
pathnames in its index files.  You cannot move the data files
after indexing them or neither wais nor gopher searches of
these wais indices will work.  

Gopher further complicates this pathname issue in that the
indexing must be done within the gopher home directory
(e.g., /usr/gopher-data or whatever you call it).

Next, to get gopher to work with wais, you must compile gopher
after compiling the wais binaries, and you must symbolicly link
the wais subfolders bin/, ir/, lib/, ui/ and x/ into your gopher/
source toplevel directory.  You must also compile them with the
same compiler (gcc on one and sun cc on another doesn't work for
me).

Assuming your gopherd & wais programs compile okay, and that the
waisindex and waissearch programs work on the wais/wais-sources
test data, and you have moved your real data into your gopher-data/
folder, then indexed it with waisindex and put the resulting index
files into someplace like gopher-data/.indices/ named as you like
(for instance my-data.src, my-data.inv, etc.)  then you must BY HAND
CREATE a new file for gopher to use these wais indices properly
called gopher-data/.indices/my-data.hostdata

In this my-data.hostdata file you put three lines:
gopher.server.internet.address
gopher-server-port
/full/path/to/gopher/root

Or as an example from my gopher server:
ftp.bio.indiana.edu
70
/usr/gopher-data

For each wais indexing set of files you create with waisindex,
you must create a new index.hostdata file by hand to go with it
for the gopherd program to use.

Then you can create a link file in your gopher data folder somewhere
which points to this wais-created index file, something like

% cat -> .link-to-wais
#
Name=Search My data
Path=7/.indices/my-data
Type=7
Host=+
Port=+
#

Notes here:  the Path must point to your newly created index files
(but without the extentions like .src, .inv or .hostdata) and
must start with "7" to indicate a search type.  Ditto for the
Type value.  The Path is relative to the gopher root (drop the
/usr/gopher-data which is the path to the top of your gopher
root).

If you want to use the IUBio extensions to wais, you need to pay
a few attention to compile-type symbols in the Makefiles:

The iubio-wais release is distributed with a Makefile that says
something like

CC=gcc
...
CFLAGS= ... -DBOOLEANS -DPARTIALWORDS -DLITERALS  #-DBIO

These defaults will compile it with gcc and with the commonly
prefered options.  If you know you want the additional features
provided with the -DBIO flag, uncomment that option.

If you don't want the -DBIO option, you are set with gopherd
as well as wais.  If you do uncomment the -DBIO option in
the wais Makefile, you must also uncomment a similar -DBIO
option in the gopher Makefile.  The -DBIO option enables
use of user delimiters in defining words, and a few other odds
and ends that most gopher/wais servers don't care about.
