The IUBio Biology Archive is now available thru internet Gopher.
Try it out and see how you like it.

The current gopher setup for it is experimental and will change. 
The archive is available more traditionally via anonymous ftp
to ftp.bio.indiana.edu.   I will be adding gopher &/or WAIS
indexing and other goodies as time permits.

>From gopher software, you can reach the IUBio gopher at the
same location you find the ftp archive.  Using the gopher unix
curses client this would look like:
  % gopher ftp.bio.indiana.edu

>From the gopher Mac client, use the menu to change the setup
from "gopher.micro.umn.edu" to "ftp.bio.indiana.edu", same
port 70.
  
If you have a gopher server, you can add a tunnel to this one
with this .link file:
 Name=IUBio Biology Archive, Indiana University (experimental)
 Type=1
 Port=70
 Path=1/
 Host=ftp.bio.indiana.edu
 
As a reminder, there is client software for many computers, including
Mac, PC, NeXT, Unix text or xwindow, and VMS.
If you want to get the most recent releases of the gopher software,
you can get these via anonymous ftp from boombox.micro.umn.edu in
the /pub/gopher directory.
