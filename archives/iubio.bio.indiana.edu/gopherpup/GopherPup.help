\pard\plain \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 \f20 GopherPup is an Internet information client program, usable on the common computer systems including Macintosh, Motif/X\-
Windows and MS-Windows.  It provides an easy-to-use, sophisticated doorway to a wide range of Internet information services.\par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 
This program supports all Gopher+ protocol features, including dialogs for client-server interactions, simple and sophisticated multiple view handling, and display of document dates, sizes, and abstracts.  It further supports HTML/HTTP (under development) 
and SMTP Mail protocols.\par 
\pard \s2\sb240\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 Document formats supportted include Microsoft's Rich Text Format ({\b RTF}) for display of fully formatted documents.  These can include a {\f22 variety} of {\f21 fonts} including {\f23 symbols}, font {\fs36 sizes} and 
{\b\i\ul styles}, {\up6 super-}scripting and {\dn4 sub-}scripting, tabbing, paragraph formatting, and pictures in both vector and bitmap forms.  Also supported are Apple Macintosh\rquote s {\b PICT} vector and bitmap graphic format, for Compuserve\rquote 
s {\b GIF} bitmap graphic format, and for CERN\rquote s {\b HTML} network document format, as well as plain {\b text}.\par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 
This software supports network hypertext links in documents.  This lets documents have hot-spots that connect to other documents or information services on the network.  Documents created in a wordprocessor can be directly displayed and network link
s can be placed by simple drag-and-drop methods.  Such links may be applied to all displayable documents.  \par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 The current version adds the ability to browse and search local information in the same way that network servers are used.  Searching local data with a version of WAIS software is possible.\par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 GopherPup is based on the earlier GopherApp program for Macintosh computers.   It is freely available at <ftp://iubio.bio.indiana.edu:/util/gopher/gopherpup/>.  It is built on a cross-platform toolkit from the Nat'
l Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and further extended by the author\rquote 
s object-oriented application framework called DCLAP.   The source for these toolkits and the applicaiton are freely available.  The home archive location for DCLAP is at <ftp://iubio.bio.indiana.edu:/util/dclap/>.\par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 This release still includes several bugs and not yet suitable for extensive use.  There are application executables for Macintosh, MS-Windows, and Sun Sparcstation, and Silicon Graphics.  Other systems are supported
 by the underlying toolkit.  Source code is available, at the DCLAP home.\par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 Comments, bug reports and suggestions for new features may be sent to    GopherPup@Bio.Indiana.Edu\par

\pard\plain \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 \f20 GopherPup is an Internet information client program, usable on the common computer systems including Macintosh, Motif/X\-
Windows and MS-Windows. It provides an easy-to-use, sophisticated doorway to a wide range of Internet information services. This software is archived for public access at <ftp://iubio.bio.indiana.edu:/util/gopher/gopherpup/>.\par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 
Internet Gopher gives you access to a wide range of information services that are now developing on the Internet.  Gopher is something like Telnet or FTP (file transfer), but also different.  It includes some of the keyword searching features of WAIS (Wide
 Area Information Services). There are currently several biology gopher services found around the globe. These include fast and up\-to-date keyword searches of GenBank, EMBL, PIR and other important biology databanks.\par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 Gopher works 
something like the Macintosh Finder, only over the Internet.  There are several file types, include Text documents, Folders with more items, Search items to search databases for keyword matches, Binhex encoded Mac programs that you can fetch, and others.
\par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 When you find folders in a Gopher window, you can double-\-click them to open a new window with more items.  [{\fs18 not in current release:}
 There is a drop-down menu at the top of each gopher window to select parent windows.]\par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 The Internet features of GopherPup let
 you interchange ideas and data with people and computing services around the world.  If your computer is connected already to the Internet, you probably are familiar with electronic mail and some of its uses.  GopherPup includes a selection of network acc
ess features including a feature to send e-\-mail.\par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 GopherPup will work properly over a telephone/modem connection to a Point to Point Protocol (PPP) or Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) server.  This is how it was developed in large part.\par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 This program su
pports Gopher+ methods, including ASK forms that make it possible to provide client-server dialogs for various information analysis needs, and supports multiple view formats, so that you can fetch versions of documents that most suit your computer system.
\par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 Release 0.2 adds support for Microsoft's {\cf5 Rich Text Format} (RTF) for display of fully formatted documents.  These can include a {\f22 variety} of {\f21 fonts} including {\f23 symbols}, font {\fs36 sizes} and {
\b\i\ul styles}, with {\up6 super-}scripting and {\dn4 sub-}scripting, tabbing, paragraph formatting,
 and pictures (in both vector and bitmap forms).  Details of RTF and the source for Paul Dubois' RTF reader on which GopherPup bases its support is available at ftp.primate.wisc.edu:/pub/RTF.\par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 Release 0.2 also adds {\cf5 network hypertext links}
 as an extension of Gopher+ protocol.  This permits documents to have hot-spots that link to other documents or information serives on the network.  Double-clicking on items highlighted like this will connect to a network service.  This release currently s
upports only the +M
ENUSTRING: method of marking links in a document.  Support for +MENULINE and +MENURECT will be added later. An addition to the article linked above is the use of +QUERYSTRING, which allows a Gopher Query (type 7) item to be searched for a specified string 
without prompting the user.  This lets document words and phrases be marked as text to search in a server database.  See the document at <ftp://iubio.bio.indiana.edu/util/dclap/docs/how-to-build-gopherpup.rtf> for discussion of the hypertext extensions to 
Gopher+ protocol used here.\par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 \par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 GopherPup is based directly on the author's earlier GopherApp program for Macintosh computers.  It includes, or will include, the same feature set and general user interface.\par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 
It is built on top of a cross-platform toolkit from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), especially Jonathan Kans' Vibrant user-interface toolkit, which works on Macintosh, MS-Windows and X/Motif (Unix and VMS) systems.  This NCBI tool
box is in the public domain and is archived at\par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 \tab ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:/toolbox\par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 
While it includes a lot of code for mananging bio-sequences, the basic core library and vibrant graphic user interface sections are useful to any kind of application that would want to run on the common computer platforms of today.  This toolkit is written
 in ANSI C, and instructions are included for compiling it on Macintosh, MS Windows, various Unix and VMS systems.\par 
On top of the NCBI toolkit, the author built a C++ application framework that is patterned after the MacApp application
 library which the previous GopherApp was based on.  This application framework, called Don's Class Application Library (DCLAP), will be available freely to the public, for those wishing to use it for development of platform independent applications.  The 
home archive location for DCLAP is \{ftp,gopher\} to\par

The rich text windows display documents of various formats, including plain text, rich text format (RTF), picture formats PICT and GIF, and hypertext markup language format (HTML).    You can select and copy portions text in the view.   These documents can
 be printed, and saved to disk files.  These views may contain network links from the document, or ones that you add by dragging items from a link list and dropping it onto selected text or image areas in the rich view. \par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 Rich documents are stored in their original formats.  GopherPup cannot yet interconvert among these formats.  \par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 
A rich text window has control buttons at the top for tacking it, and for moving back and foreward among the documents stored in that window. The tack button when upright will prevent any new documents from displaying in that window.  The back button mo
ves to any prior documents in that window.  The fore button moves to any documents ahead of the current on in the window\par

\pard\plain \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 \f20 When you use GopherPup, it looks for associated data files:  GopherPup.help, which is a network rich text document ( a modified RTF),  GopherPup.go4, which is a network link 
document containing any of your favorite network links, and GopherPup.prefs, which is checked at startup for new preference settings.\par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 
The GopherPup.go4 file is in gopher+ protocol format, and has links to any servers you wish to see at startup.  Alternately you can save any link list window as a file and open again. Versions of GopherApp let you copy and paste items between gopher docume
nts.  GopherPup will eventually support this feature to let you easily create documents of links to your favorite network 
services.  You can alternatively edit a gopher document with a text editor, as long as you maintain the following format used in the Gopher transaction protocol:\par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 [Type Char] [Title....] <tab> [Path] <tab>[Host.address] <tab>[Port#] <cr>\par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 An optional <tab>+ after the Port will specify a Gopher+ server. This line format is repeated for any number of lines.\par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 The New and Open commands on the File menu will let you create new or open old Gopher files.  You should use Copy/Paste and dragging gopher items, as well a
s the "New gopher link" and "Edit gopher link" commands to create gopher document files that suit your tastes.\par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 
You may also edit a gopher document file as if it were a TEXT file.  When you save such a file, it is saved as a TEXT type.  GopherPup will currently let you try to open any file (on Macs, this is a bit of a user-interface boo-boo), and if it looks like a 
gopher document format, it will display the gopher links, otherwise it will try to display it as a plain text document.  \par

\pard\plain \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 \f20 Some features of GopherPup include \par 
\pard \s2\fi-360\li360\sb100\tx1440\tx6480 \emdash \tab 
In the main gopher item windows, you see "+" or "?" after the icon for each item.  "-" stands for gopher-, the old format.  "+" indicates the item is gopher+ format, and "?" indicates a gopher+ ASK dialog.  A "#" indicates the item is a map that can be q
ueried by mouse positions.\par 
\pard \s2\fi-360\li360\sb100\tx1440\tx6480 \emdash \tab The date, size and network link information can be displayed, or hidden, for each gopher+ item.   Abstracts of items can be displayed, though servers may not includ them. \par 
\pard \s2\fi-360\li360\sb100\tx1440\tx6480 \emdash \tab ASK dialogs, which can include these simple user interface elements of edit-text lines (Ask), note-text lines (Note), edit-text blocks (AskL), checkboxes (Select), multi\-
choice pop-up menus (Choose),  password edit lines (AskP), send file to server (ChooseF).  You will see a "?" after the icon for ASK dialogs.\par 
\pard \s2\fi-360\li360\sb100\tx1440\tx6480 \emdash \tab Multiple views for an item, so a server can provide the best document or image f
ormat for many different clients and users.  See the menu item "Open link by view" to select among views in gopher+ items.\par 
\pard \s2\fi-360\li360\sb100\tx1440\tx6480 \emdash \tab 
Use the Gopher Prefs dialog to edit the view mapping from Gopher+ server to Macintosh type.  For each Gopher+ server type and handler, you must specify a Macintosh type and application signature which will handle that kind of document.  This area needs a
 better user interface and some bug squashing.\par 
\pard \s2\fi-360\li360\sb100\tx1440\tx6480 \emdash \tab The menu item "Mail to link maintainer" takes advantage of Gopher+'s publishing of gopher item maintainer email addresses.\par 
\pard \s2\fi-360\li360\sb100\tx1440\tx6480 \emdash \tab The get info item will use Gopher+'s info query to return details of an item.\par 
\pard \s2\fi-360\li360\sb100\tx1440\tx6480 \emdash \tab View links by size, date, name, host, etc. lets you sort a gopher directory according to those criteria.  The view as text creates a text file representation of the directory.\par 
\emdash   "Find home of link" for Veronica users & other cases to locate root server for any given gopher link.\par 
\pard \s2\fi-360\li360\sb100\tx1440\tx6480 \emdash \tab Mapping of Gopher+ types to local types, in the Preferences, has been revised to use a button to choose a Ma
c application and menu to select from its known file types.  Ditto for Gopher- and server mapping (these latter two features are of less importance with advent of gopher+).\par 
\pard \s2\fi-360\li360\sb100\tx1440\tx6480 \emdash \tab Support is added support for the new basic gopher- types of moo-V (;) and Note (i).\par

\pard\plain \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 \f20 
GopherPup version 0.3 still has many known bugs.  Rendering of any document formats is still incomplete and prone to mistakes.  It tends to crash, in different places on different OSes. The Mac versions are currently most s
table, with XWindows and MSWin-32bit about equally stable, and 16 bit MSWin relatively unstable (the app runs into 16bit limits too frequently).\par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 
RTF rendering lacks advanced formatting features of headers/footers and footnotes, table, table-of-contents and indexing.  There are also mistakes in the positioning of lines, in the placement of some styling, and others.   PICT image displace makes mistak
es in some cases where it shouldn't, and its use with polygon data is probably bad, its handling of clipping, s
ome positioning, etc. is off.  Pixel maps and some bitmaps on XWindows are not well handled yet.  MSWindows has a bug in GIF display.  HTML rendering is likewise incomplete in various respects -- forms have not been implemented, though that may be availabl
e soon.  \par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 
Gopher items that it will not yet properly handle include Telnet, CSO, and some other special purpose gopher types.  It will handle Image, Movie, Sound and similar types if they have an associated external handler program properly configured for use.

\pard\plain \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 \f20 
One of the impressive things I remember when I first when to a large university after growing up in a small town, was finding the library. My home town library was a place of discovery and enjoyment for me. When I went off to college, the 
library was one of the first things I looked into.  I spent much time looking around this mountain of knowledge, and I learned much, perhaps more than from classes, in these big libraries.\par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 That is the way Internet Gopher strikes me \emdash 
 like going from a small town library to a big university one.  It is a very simple but powerful way to bring information from anywhere, locally or world-wide, to your personal computer.  It is easy to set up gop
her servers.  It is very easy to use the gopher clients.   Gopher and WAIS provide somewhat different protocols for serving information out to clients over the Internet.  Gopher is strong on browsing -{\fs20\dn4  }\-
you can find new things just by pointing at lists.  WAIS is strong on linking together many dispersed servers to answer a given question.  \par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 
Internet Gopher is an information distribution system. It combines features of electronic bulletin board services and databases, allowing you to either browse a hierarchy of information, or to search for the information you need using f
ull-text indexes.  Gopher can also store references to wide area information services (WAIS), anonymous ftp sites, public telnet sessions, phone book servers, sounds and various graphic documents.\par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 
Internet Gopher gives you access to a wide range of information services  that are now developing on the Internet.  Gopher is something like Telnet or FTP (file transfer), but also different.  It includes some of the keyword searching features of WAIS (Wid
e Area Information Services).\par 
\pard \s2\sb100\tx576\tx1440\tx6480 Details about Internet Gopher, including software for clients and servers, are available at the home archive of gopher.micro.umn.edu at University of Minnesota, USA.{\fs28 \par
