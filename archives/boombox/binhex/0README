There are two versions of BinHex here.

In the MSDOS directory, you will find a BinHex utilitiy that runs under DOS.
This must be ftp-ed in binary mode.

In the Mac directory you will find a MacBinary version of BinHex 4.0.
This is for folks who don't have this most primary of Mac utilities...
FTP it back to your machine in binary mode.  When you bring it down
to your Mac, you need to bring it down as MacBinary.
