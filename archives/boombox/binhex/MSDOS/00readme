PC BinHex 1.3    University of Minnesota 1992-1993

Overview:

This Utility encodes binary files into a plain text format and 
decodes the resulting files into their original state. The 
encoding method used is called BinHex. This encoding method 
works on any type of file, including formatted word processing 
and spreadsheet files, graphics files, and even executable 
files (i.e. programs or applications). The encoded file can 
also be passed from computer to computer in its encoded form. 
The encoding will remain intact and it will be equally 
meaningless on all the machines until it is unencoded. To be 
usable or readable it must be converted back to its original 
format and be run on a compatible computer. This program is 
compatible with the Macintosh version of BINHEX and with 
POPMail (tm).

Functions:

F1: Access online help.

F2: Bin2Hex - Converts a Binary File to a BinHex encoded File.

F3: Hex2Bin - Converts a BinHex encoded File to a Binary File.
