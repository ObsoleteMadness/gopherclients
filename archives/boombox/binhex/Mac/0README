The BinHex contained in this directory is the BinHex 4.0 Mac utility.
You need to transfer it in binary mode back to your home machine.
When you transfer it back to your Mac, take the necessary steps
to ensure that you have MacBinary turned on.

If you are using NCSA Telnet, make sure MacBinary Enabled is checked
under the File menu.  Type "binary" before you do a "get BinHex" in ftp.
