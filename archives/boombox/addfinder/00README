Version 1.02 of the Address Finder stack (a Macintosh client for 
the University of Illinois CSO Nameserver) is located in this directory.
This version is for use with Hypercard 2.0.

The Address Finder stack is stored in the file addfinder.hqx; this
file is a BINHEX'ed stuffit archive. You'll need stuffit version 1.5
to reconstitute the stack. The manual (in both MacWrite II and MS Word
format) is also stored in the addfinder.hqx file.
