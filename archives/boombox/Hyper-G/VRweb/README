VRweb 1.0 Beta 3
================


VRweb is a browser for 3D worlds and scenes modeled in the Virtual
Reality Modeling Language (VRML). VRweb is a joint project between
IICM, home of Hyper-G, NCSA, home of Mosaic, and the University of
Minnesota, home of Gopher.


New in this release:

*** VRweb for Windows NT, 3.x, and 95; and DEC Ultrix ***

*** source code available for UNIX/X11 and Windows ***

* VRML samples (in VRMLsamples.tar.gz and Windows binary zips)

* faster Mesa driver under X11:
  flat shading dithered on 8bit display with no speed penalty
  smooth shading typically 5 to 10 times faster
  (use -mesabackbuf pixmap for old behaviour)

* LOD (level of detail) supported

Supported Platforms
-------------------

UNIX:

o SGI: OpenGL; Mesa
o DEC ALPHA: OpenGL; Mesa
o DEC Ultrix: Mesa          <-- new
o SUN Solaris: Mesa
o SUN OS: Mesa
o HPUX: Mesa
o LINUX: Mesa

Windows:                    <-- new

o Windows NT: OpenGL
o Windows 3.1 and 95: Mesa

The Mesa library (by brianp@ssec.wisc.edu) is an OpenGL workalike that
supports 3D graphics through the X server protocol (it neither needs
nor benefits from HW accelerators).
OpenGL needs a working GLX extension for your X-server and is part of
the Windows NT operating system.



Source Code                 <-- new
-----------

VRweb source code is now availabe for UNIX/X11 and for Windows.

UNIX/vrweb.src-1.0beta3.tar.gz contains the source code for UNIX/X11.
Look at COPYRIGHT for usage conditions, and INSTALLATION for an
installation guide.

The source for the Windows is available in Windows/vrw_src.zip,
including Makefiles for Microsoft Visual C++ 2.x. Read file readme.src
as installation guide.



How to use VRweb for UNIX/X11
-----------------------------

With your Web viewer you will need an entry similar to:

  x-world/x-vrml; vrweb-ogl %s

in your ~/.mailcap (use vrweb-mesa on non-SGI platforms).

Decompression should be dealt with by your web browser. If not, you
can hardwire gzipped decompression, for example, as follows:

  x-world/x-vrml; gzip -cd %s | vrweb-ogl -

With Harmony (the Hyper-G UNIX/X11 client) use the appropriate version
of harscened (more information on http://hyperg.iicm.tu-graz.ac.at).

Call any program with argument -h to get a short explanation of
possible arguments.



Features
--------

Support of VRML 1.0 using QvLib 1.0 as parser. Invalid VRML nodes
(read Inventor) are reported and ignored.
Grouping, Separators, Coordinates, Normals, Materials,
Cameras, Light sources, Transformations, primitive shapes,
IndexedFaceSet, IndexedLineSet, PointSet, MaterialBinding.
Since July 17: ShapeHints. Since Aug 3: LOD (level of detail).

Several navigation modes: "flip", "walk", "fly", "heads up".
Flip is a kind of examiner, heads-up is an easy to use walk
viewer. Note the short hints in the status line.

Optional switching to a lower quality during movements.



Not Yet Supported
-----------------

Among the not supported VRML features in the current beta are
the nodes dealing with text (AsciiText, FontStyle), and texturing.

A port of navigation mode "fly to" is under work.

WWWAnchor is not yet supported, WWWInline only in the harmony
version. A version with Mosaic CCI support will come out soon.
