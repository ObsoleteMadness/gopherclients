VRweb 0.53 Beta
===============

This is the NT version of VRweb a VRML browser for Microsoft Windows NT 3.5x 
and Windows 95 with native OpenGL support.

VRweb is a joint project between IICM (Hyper-G team), NCSA (mosaic), and the
Gopher team. For copyright and license please read

Installation:
=============

Due to the NT Bug # 15544 the system can be shut down with a system error using
VRweb for NT. You can use VRweb, if you either install glsrv.dll into your 
Windows NT system32 directory or contact Microsoft Product Support Services and
reference the bug.

To install VRweb create a directory and unzip the archive with 

unzip vrw_nt

Then you can create an icon in the Program Manager. In a later version we
will supply an install program.

To install VRweb with Mosaic 2.00:

Get a VRML scene from your prefered sever. Mosaic asks you whether to save the
file to disk or to configure a viewer. Select to configure a viewer and 
another dialog appears. Press the browse button and select VRweb at the location 
you did put it to. Press OK and Mosaic is configured for use with VRweb.

Configuration with Netscape is analogous.

Please note, that this version of VRweb does not support compressed scenes. If
you want to look at them you have to uncompress them first.

System requirements:
====================

To use VRweb you should have an 486-50 and 8 MB of memory or better. If
rendering is slow use as interactive mode wireframe (Menue Rendering-
Interactive-Wireframe)

Beta limitations:
=================

Because of being Beta some features are not implemented yet (but will in near 
future):

* Fly to mode is not implemented with VRML scenes
* No help available
* The user interface will be fine tuned
* No standard light source in VRML scenes
* No network support (hyperg, http)
* No unzip support
* No WWWAnchor and WWWInline support

The UseTrueColor option in the INI file is not important for this version.
