POPMAIL II 2.3B4                                 MAY 9, 1996

New Features
------------

1.  It is now possible to configure mailboxes with separate email accounts.
    This is done by selecting and opening a mailbox on the left side of
    the Message Browser window.  Then select Mailbox Configure from
    the popup Mailbox menu.  Also can set a signature for the mailbox.

    All mail fetched or sent when inside this mailbox uses the identity
    set for that specific mailbox.

Bug Fixes
---------

1.  Fixed crasher that could occur first time POPmail was used.

2.  Fixed 'Mark & Wendy' bug.  This occured if Wendy tried to pick up
    and use the phone when Mark was fetching mail.  The message was
    truncated and attempting to view it caused a crash.
