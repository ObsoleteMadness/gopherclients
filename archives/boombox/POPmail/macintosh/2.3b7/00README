POPmail II 2.3b7                                 August 8, 1996

Bug Fixes/New Features
----------------------

1.  The 'Notify me when new mail arrives' option is back.
 
2.  MIME message parts that are text are now correctly saved
    as a text file of your preset word processor. (Options -
    'Save documents for:' ).
    
3.  The 'Open Senders' selection in the windows menu has been
    improved.  Previously this opened all partially composed,
    but unsent, messages.
    
    It has been expanded so you can choose to open a specific
    message.  Selecting the message title in the menu will
    either bring the window to the front if already open, or
    open the message and display it.  Also appearing in the
    menu will be any messages that were unable to be posted
    because of a bad network connection.

POPmail II 2.3b6                                 July 3, 1996

Bug Fixes/New Features
----------------------

1.  The 'Find' command once again indicates whether the search string
    was found.

2.  Problem with decoding some AppleDouble MIME attachments fixed.

3.  Not always displaying the message text (with mail sent from
    variant mailers) fixed.

4.  Fixed the problem of incorrectly stating there were attachments.

5.  Timing bug that may have been causing groups to be lost was patched.

6.  No longer dependent on TurboGopher for helper application prefs.

    This version has a resource specifying helper apps to use.  The id
    of the 'Str' resource is 128.  It comes set with the following.
    'TGOFMOSSFTChNNTPPHEDMOSS'  Each 4 characters is the signature of the
    application for a specific protocol.  The protocol ordering is:
    Gopher, http, ftp, nntp, ph, https (http secure).  The application
    preferences for the above are initially set to TurboGopher, Netscape,
    Fetch, NewsWatcher, Ph, and Netscape.

    Of course to customize you will need to drop POPmail on ResEdit to
    set your helper app preferences.

    clipped 3 characters too short.

    that mailbox will no longer use the global signature.

POPmail II 2.3b4                                  May 9, 1996

New Features
------------

1.  It is now possible to configure mailboxes with separate email accounts.
    This is done by selecting and opening a mailbox on the left side of
    the Message Browser window.  Then select Mailbox Configure from
    the popup Mailbox menu.  Also can set a signature for the mailbox.

    All mail fetched or sent when inside this mailbox uses the identity
    set for that specific mailbox.

Bug Fixes
---------

1.  Fixed crasher that could occur first time POPmail was used.

2.  Fixed 'Mark & Wendy' bug.  This occured if Wendy tried to pick up
    and use the phone when Mark was fetching mail.  The message was
    truncated and attempting to view it caused a crash.
