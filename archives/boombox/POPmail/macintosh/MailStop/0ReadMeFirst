This is the MailStop distribution directory.

MailStop is a mail-server application for the Mac.  You should use
POPmail II (or the current version of PC POPmail) to work with this 
server; look in the POPmail directory.
Use the newest version in either case.

This directory contains the following files:

MailStop.hqx        Current version of MailStop (1.1.6).
Doc*MacWriteII.hqx  Documentation in MacWrite II format, binhexed (preferred).
Doc*Word.hqx        Documentation in Messy Word format, binhexed.

All the documentation is set in the Palatino font (if you don't have
Palatino, the documentation will look ugly.)
Older versions of MailStop are in the directory OldVersions.

The MailStop manual refers to a document called "Setting Up MacTCP", which
is also included in the documentation.  This document was written for the
needs of the University of Minnesota Campus and talks about pre-configured
MacTCP prep files.  These pre-configured files are available to folks on
campus (via the HelpLine and online via the Mac Information Server) but
are not in this distribution for anonymous ftp.  Obtaining MacTCP and
configuring it is something you folk in netland will have to do yourself.

Single copies of MacTCP are available from APDA.  Apple also has site
licenses available.  The document "Setting up MacTCP" should have enough
information to help you get things configured right.
