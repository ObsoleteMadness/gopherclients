Beta Release, WS_PopMail 1.07-P
April 4, 1996

Contained in this directory are two self-extracting
archives, poparc.exe and labarc.exe.  They are the latest
test versions of Popmail and labpop for Windows.  We would
like to encourage interested parties to download and
try out these programs while keeping in mind their 
delicate, Beta-test-ish nature.

There are several improvements over the previous version,
including ability to view larger messages, and better
handling of retaining browser position when deleting
multiple messages. 

Perhaps the most interesting improvement is support for
PEM-style digital signatures on e-mail. The PEM support
depends on the presence of the POPPEM.DLL file. We will
release the DLL once we have completed the documentation
(this should during the week of April 8 - 14). A similar
version of POPmail with PEM support for the Macintosh is 
also available, and at the time of release of the
PEM DLL and Mac plugin, we will also have a standalone
Certificate Authority available. 

As always, any comments/questions should be directed to
popmail@boombox.micro.umn.edu.
