The source for the POP2 server written at
the University of Minnesota is located in this directory
in the file popd.c. Note that there are loads of comments
at the beginning of the popd.c file that explain how to 
compile and test the POP2 daemon. 

HP9000 users will probably want to use the HP9000 version
(hp9000_popd.c). This version was contributed by
