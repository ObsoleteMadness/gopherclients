 ============================================
   Minuet and Multiple Users    ( WINDOWS )
 ============================================

As e-mail becomes more popular, we are seeing more worksites where many 
people in the office have to share the same computer.

What do you need to do to have many users of Minuet on the same computer
without placing multiple copies of Minuet on the hard disk? And how can
you do this using Windows?

1.  Establish a DIRECT internet connection for the computer.  (See
    separate instructions for using a SLIP connection.)

2.  Register the computer with networking services for BOOTP service.
    This will allow for the automatic set-up of required 
    networking configuration parameters (namely: IP, Net Mask,
    Name Servers, and Gateways).
    
3.  Include C:\MINUET in the path statement.


To Set Up Each User
-------------------
1.  Assign a unique 3-letter ID code to each user.  
    A user's initials work well for this purpose.  For example, 
       Mortimer A. Snerd  ---> MAS
       Jane B. Doe        ---> JBD

2.  Start Windows and make a new Program Item.
    
       select File/New/Program Item

3.  In the Description field enter a name including the assigned
    ID code:

       Minuet HisOrHerInitials
  
    for example:

       Minuet MAS

4.  In the Command Line enter the following:

       c:\minuet\minuet /p=c:\mail\HisOrHerInitials

    for example:

       c:\minuet\minuet /p=c:\mail\MAS

5.  The user starts Minuet from the new Windows icon.

    Minuet will automatically establish a separate subdirectory for 
    the user in C:\MAIL\.

6.  Set up Minuet as usual. That is, fill in the E-Mail Address
    and Password fields in the "Setup/User" dialog box.
    NOTE:  Leave the Subdirectory for mail field EMPTY.

7.  Each time you want to run Minuet, use your Windows icon.
        
To set up a second user, make a new Windows Program Item (steps 2,3,4
above) with the name or initials of the second user. Start Minuet with
the new Windows icon. (A new subdirectory is automatically created.)
Go to the Setup/User menu in Minuet and set up the E-Mail Address and
Password as usual. That's all there is to it!
