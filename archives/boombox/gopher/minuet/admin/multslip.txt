   SLIP, Minuet, Multiple Users    ( DOS )
 ===========================================

As e-mail becomes more popular, we are seeing more worksites where many
people in the office have to share the same computer.

What do you need to do to have many users of Minuet on the same computer
without placing multiple copies of Minuet on the hard disk? How is this
done with a SLIP connection.

1.  Establish a modem connection for the computer. Use either a data 
    phone (ADI modem), or a modem connected to a standard phone line.
    (See separate instructions for using a DIRECT connection.)

2.  Follow the normal install procedure as described in the "PC SLIP
    Quick Start Instructions" handout to install the software.

  NOTE: You must be using PHONE.EXE version 2.3. When you are in 
        "SLIP SETUP", press Alt-Spacebar and then press Enter.  
        A dialog box will tell you the version you have installed.


To Set Up Each User
-------------------
1.  Assign a unique 3-letter ID code to each user.  
    A user's initials work well for this purpose.  For example, 
       Mortimer A. Snerd  ---> MAS
       Jane B. Doe        ---> JBD

2.  The user types:

       slip minuet HisOrHerInitials

    for example:

       slip minuet JBD

    PHONE will establish a SLIP connection if necessary, and Minuet will
    automatically make a separate subdirectory for the user in C:\MAIL\.

3.  Set up Minuet as usual. That is, fill in the E-Mail Address
    and Password fields in the "Setup/User" dialog box.
    NOTE:  Leave the Subdirectory for mail field EMPTY.

4.  Each time you want to run Minuet type:
 
       slip minuet HisOrHerInitials


To set up a second user, quit Minuet and type "slip minuet XYZ" where 
"XYZ" is the name or initials of the second user. (A new subdirectory 
is automatically created.) Go to the Setup/User menu in Minuet and set
up the E-Mail Address and Password as usual. That's all there is to it!
