This is the "admin" directory of Minuet.

It contains files of interest to system and network administrators,
or anyone who will be distributing or installing Minuet for others.

This area is still under construction,so please bear with the incomplete
and sketchy information presented here.

The "NewsINfo" server

The News feature of Minuet works better if a "newsinfo" server is available.
"NewsInfo" is a server that supplies the Minuet client with condensed news
group information.  THis is particularly useful over slow SLIP links,
or if your news server has thousands of newsgroups.  Minuet can run
without the newsinfo server-- it just runs much faster with it.

The newsinfo server we supply is written as a Perl script.  It is a 
mostly-competent, quite efficient server.  It has a few site configurable
parameters at the top of the script.  Further information will be forthcoming.
