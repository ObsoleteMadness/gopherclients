What's New in Acrobat Reader 2.0.1 for Macintosh?
=================================================

Acrobat Reader 2.0.1 now includes full ATM(TM) 3.8.2. 

Should I Use Acrobat Reader 2.0r3 or 2.0.1?
===========================================

In general, Adobe recommends you use Acrobat Reader 2.0.1. 

There are no feature differences between Acrobat Reader 2.0r3 and
Acrobat Reader 2.0.1. You may choose to use the version
appropriate to your system configuration. If you are
redistributing the Reader, you should consider the system
configurations of your intended audience. 

 o If your system is a 68XXX-based Macintosh without QuickDraw GX,
   you may use Acrobat Reader 2.0r3. Acrobat Reader 2.0r3 has
   smaller disk and memory requirements, but supports fewer
   platform configurations. 

 o If your system is a Power Macintosh or you have QuickDraw GX
   enabled, use Acrobat Reader 2.0.1. Acrobat Reader 2.0.1
   supports more systems, but has greater disk and memory
   requirements. 

Acrobat Reader 2.0r3 includes ATM LE. To enable Acrobat Reader
2.0r3 and ATM LE to fit on a single floppy, ATM LE does not
include support for QuickDraw GX, Kanji, or 68000-based
Macintoshes, and does not have native Power Macintosh code for
improved performance on Power Macintoshes like the full version of
ATM which is included with Acrobat Reader 2.0.1. The Acrobat
Reader 2.0r3 application is not compatible with QuickDraw GX. 

Acrobat Reader 2.0.1 supports QuickDraw GX and includes full
ATM(TM) 3.8.2.
