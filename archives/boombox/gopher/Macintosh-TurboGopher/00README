Documentation for TurboGopher is included inside the application.
Select the Help item from the Gopher menu.

To convert old Bookmarks (from 1.0.8 etc), save the Bookmarks
in a Bookmark file using 1.0.8.  Then launch 2.0 and select
Open from the File menu while holding down the Option Key.
You will be able to open the old Bookmark file and it will be
converted to the new kind.
