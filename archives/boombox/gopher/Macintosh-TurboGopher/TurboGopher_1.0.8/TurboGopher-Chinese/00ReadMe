Hello,

This version of TurboGopher is based on the English
version 1.0.8b4.  The only difference is this version
has been localized for Simplified Chinese.

I wish to extend my thanks to Zongshi Ji.  This version
is based on her translation.  I have tried to accurately
carry her translations forward though some errors might
have been introduced.  I willingly take the blame for
any errors.  :-)

Though if you do notice any errors I would appreciate
being notified.  If you send a message regarding an error
please specify the incorrect text, and the correct text
that should replace it.

Or just modify your copy of TurboGopher with ResEdit and
send a modified copy to dmj@boombox.micro.umn.edu.  Please
specify which items you have changed.


Thank you,
David Johnson
