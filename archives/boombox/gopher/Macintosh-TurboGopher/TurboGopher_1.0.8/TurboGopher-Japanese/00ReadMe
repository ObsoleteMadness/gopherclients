Haikei,

This version of TurboGopher is based on the English
version 1.0.8b4.  The only difference is this version
has been localized for the Japanese Language.

I wish to extend my thanks to Hiroshi Mizushima.  He
localized an earlier version of TurboGopher for the
Japanese Language. 

This version is based on his translation.  I have
tried to accurately carry his translations forward
though some errors might have been introduced.  I
willingly take the blame for any errors.  :-)

Though if you do notice any errors I would appreciate
being notified.  If you send a message regarding an error
please specify the incorrect text, and the correct text
that should replace it.  Please send the incorrect
text string and the correct replacement in Japanese.
