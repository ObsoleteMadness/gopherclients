Hello gopheradmin(s) at Minnesota,

   some months ago I started working on a gopher server for Windows 3.1 and
I'm now far enough to make a public pre-release. This mail carries the
current release, version 0.52.
I would like to ask you now for two things:

      - if you want to put it to your gopher server archives, and

      - your comments and suggestions about it (if you find the
	time to do).
