		   HGopher Information Centre, Official Opening

I have set up a area of gopherspace for information relating to the windows
hgopher client.

You can connect to this to pick up the gopher client and  related documents.
Also I have a growing collection of viewers and an assault course on which
you can test out hgopher and the viewers you have set up.

Currently I have the following viewers available (note some, infact most
are Shareware).

	A PostScript viewer
	JPEG and GIF viewers
	A CSO viewer
	A MPEG viewer
	A Zip file processor


Access details are below.

# Access via a gopher+ server

Or

# Access via a gopher0 server
