NOTIS Systems, working with the University of Minnesota, is
offering a graphical user interface Gopher client for the
Internet. Called WinGopher, the product is a Windows-based
PC client that organizes and simplifies Internet access
through point-and-click access to Gopher servers throughout
the Internet.

WinGopher works with any viewer (text, WAVE, GIF, and AVI)
and includes both a text and GIF document viewer. Using
bookmarks called "collections", WinGopher retains frequently
accessed servers or documents in user-defined groups. The
graphical interface works with any WinSock DLL-compliant
communications package to connect to any gopher server
without typing server addresses or logon commands.

For information on WinGopher, call NOTIS Systems directly at
1-800-55-NOTIS (1-800-556-6847) or fax to: 708-866-4893 or
send e-mail to <easton@NOTIS.COM>.
