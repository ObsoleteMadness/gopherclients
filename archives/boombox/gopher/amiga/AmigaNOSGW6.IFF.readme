The AmigaNOSGW6.IFF is a true snapshot (off of a super hi-res interlaced
screen) of AmigaNOSGW and the Amiga Gopher client running. The original
screen size was: 1376x464. You will need a viewer utility such as ViewTek
which allows you to scroll around if you cannot normally view such large
screens.

This snapshot is offered for those who don't have the Amiga Gopher client
yet, and wanted to see something of what it looks like.
