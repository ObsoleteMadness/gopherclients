About Version 1.61 of the OS/2 Gopher Client
 
This version matches the one made available on the "Developer's
Connection" Volume 3 CD-ROM.
 
 
There are many changes to the client from version 1.04; some of the
most significant are:
 
*  True multithreading in all TCP/IP processing
 
*  The default representation of a Gopher menu now uses icons; you can
   have multiple windows on screen at once.
 
*  Mouse Button 2 brings up a popup menu pertaining to the current item
   or the current menu.
 
*  Printing (though it's NOT multithreaded and is only to LPT1) from the
   viewer window
 
*  You can specify a viewer program for any Gopher type (see the Options
   notebook)
 
*  Speed improvements
 
*  Rexx support to supply the name of a file to be saved or downloaded
 
*  Lots of fit and finish improvements
 
There's a complete change log in the GOPHER.CHA file inside the ZIPfile.
 
 
 
What's not in this version?
