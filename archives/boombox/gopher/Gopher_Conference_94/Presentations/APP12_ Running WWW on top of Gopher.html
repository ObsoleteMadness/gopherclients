At Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), we wanted to set up a 
World-Wide-Web (WWW) server.
A few months earlier we had already set up a Gopher server.  Rather
than maintaining two separate systems, with a plain ASCII copy of the
information in one system along with an HTML version in the other, we decided
to write a WWW server that would make use of the existing Gopher
information structure.
<p>
Of course, you don't need to do anything special in order to view
Gopher information
via the Web, you can simply use the URL of the form
<pre>
gopher://nodename/type/path
</pre>
to point to your existing Gopher server.  However, we wanted the
ability to
enhance the existing information using HTML, without having to
duplicate all of it.  The following goals lead to the development of
the <i>gopherhttpd</i> server:
<ul>
<li>Seamless integration of Gopher and WWW from the perspective of
both the users and the information provider.  If a new document is
added to the Gopher system, it should automatically appear in the WWW
system.
<li>Provide a WWW server that installs and operates much like a Gopher
server to allow existing system and network managers to install a WWW
server with little additional training.
<li>Provide the ability to completely override ASCII documents in
Gopher with HTML documents in WWW when desired.
<li>Allow easy annotation of the existing Gopherspace.
<li>Provide nicely formatted HTML pages by default.
</ul>
<p>
This document describes the <i>gopherhttpd</i> server that achieves all of
the above goals.  The installation and operation of this server will
be described, and examples from the LANL server will be shown.

<h1>Overview of <i>gopherhttpd</i></h1>
The easiest way to understand the power of <i>gopherhttpd</i> is to take a
look at an example.
<p>
<a href="gopher://gopher.lanl.gov/">Here is what the LANL Gopher server looks like.</a>
<p>
<a href="http://www.lanl.gov/">Here is what the LANL WWW Home Page looks like.</a>
<p>
The LANL WWW Home Page was generated "on the fly" based upon
information from the LANL Gopher server.  Note that all of the Gopher
menu items appear in the WWW Home Page.  Each menu item is "annotated"
with a short description.  In addition, the entire menu is preceded
by a short description (like an "About" or "README" file would
normally be used for in Gopher).
<p>
Note that the WWW Home Page takes full advantage of HTML, including
the ability to present a logo.  

<h2>A Closer Look</h2>
Let's take a closer look at each element in the LANL WWW Home Page and
see how it is generated from the data on the Gopher server.
<p>
<hr>
&lt;Optional logo>
<p>
This text is used to describe the current page.  It is optional.  The
contents of this section are taken from the file
<code>README.html</code> in the current Gopher directory.  This file
can contain any HTML code that is desired.
<dl>
<dt>&lt;optional icon><a href="">First Menu Item</a>
<dd>Description of the First Menu Item.  This section is optional.
<dt>&lt;optional icon><a href="">Second Menu Item</a>
<dd>Description of Second Menu Item
</dl>
________________________________________
<address>Author Name or email address</address>
<hr>
<p>
Each of the Menu Items in the template shown above are taken from the
Gopher menu.  The <i>gopherhttpd</i> server reads both the
<code>.cap</code> files and the <code>.Links</code> 
files and produces a menu just like the Gopher menu.  Each menu
item corresponds to a specific file or directory in Gopherspace.  The
description of this file or directory is read from the file
<code>filename.about.html</code> where <code>filename</code> is the
name of the Gopher file or directory.  The optional icon is taken
from the file <code>.cap/filename.gif</code> if it exists.
<p>
The only thing that was done to the Gopher server to make all of this
work was to add the line
<pre>
ignore:		.html
</pre>
to the <code>gopherd</code> configuration file.  Thus, any file ending in
<code>.html</code> will be ignore by the Gopher server, and handled instead by
<i>gopherhttpd</i>.
<p>
The Author name or email address shown at the bottom of the screen is
taken from a file in the current Gopher directory called
<code>AUTHOR.html</code>.
If this file is not present, and is not found in any parent directories,
default information contained in the
<i>gopherhttpd</i> configuration file is placed here instead.  Since this
information can contain any HTML commands, you can provides links to
your phone book entries.
<p>
That's it!  This is the basic template for every HTML page created by
<i>gopherhttpd</i> from your existing Gopher menus.

<h1>Further Customization</h1>
There are some tricks that you can use to further customize the look
of your WWW server.
<p>
Normally, <i>gopherhttpd</i> will automatically create the URL for each item
in the menu to point to either another menu, or to the information
file itself.  If the file <code>filename.html</code> exists, then a
link to this file will be generated instead.  This allows you to completely
override a file in Gopher with an HTML file by putting both into the
same Gopher directory.  Since Gopher ignores HTML files, Gopher users
will only see the original data, and WWW users will only see the HTML
data.
<p>
You can prevent Gopher items from appearing in the WWW page by adding
a file to the Gopher directory called <code>filename.ignore</code>  Of
course, you then also need to tell your Gopher server to ignore files
that end in <code>.ignore</code>.  To avoid this, <i>gopherhttpd</i>
also recognizes the file <code>.cap/filename.ignore</code>.
Now Gopher users will see the
original <code>filename</code>, but <i>gopherhttpd</i> will omit it from the
WWW menu.

<h1>Extensions to the Gopher .cap files</h1>
Instead of creating description files using the
<code>filename.about.html</code> method described above, you can
achieve this same effect through some extensions to the Gopher
<code>.cap/filename</code> 
and <code>.Links</code> files.  
Gopher clients ignore lines in these files that do
not start with recognized keywords.  Thus, we have added some new
keywords that <i>gopherhttpd</i> will recognize, but Gopher will ignore.
Here is a list of the new keywords:
<dl>
<dt><code>Desc</code>
<dd>Allows you to specify the description to be placed under the menu
item name.  Only a single line description is allowed, but that line
can be as long as you want, and Mosaic will wrap the long line as
needed into a full paragraph.
<dt><code>WWW</code>
<dd>What if a system is running both a Gopher and a WWW server?
Normally, <i>gopherhttpd</i>
points to the Gopher system.  You can override this using the
<code>WWW=url</code> option in the <code>.cap</code> file.  The <code>url</code>
specified on 
this line will be used as the menu item.  Also, a line in the
description field will automatically be generated that says
<p><dl><dl>
<dt>You can also access their <a href="">Gopher</a> server.
</dl></dl>
<p>
which points to the Gopher system.
If you put an asterisk (*) at the end of the URL, this Gopher message
will be supressed.  A dollar-sign ($) in the URL is expanded from the
<code>Host</code> field.  If the protocol string is missing from the
front of the URL, <code>http://</code> is added by default.  Thus, the
string
<p>
<code>WWW=$/welcome.html</code>
<p>
will generate a menu item with a link of
<code>http://hostname/welcome.html</code> where <code>hostname</code> is taken
from the <code>Host=hostname</code> line in the <code>.cap</code> file.
<dt><code>Pre</code>
<dd>HTML text assigned to Pre will be output immediately before the
highlighted Name of the menu item.
<dt><code>Post</code>
<dd>HTML text assigned to Post will be output immediately after the
highlighted Name of the menu item.
<dt><code>Before</code>
<dd>HTML text assigned to Before will be also output before the menu item,
but also before the <code>&lt;dt></code> that flags the start of the
menu item.  
You can think of this text as appearing after the Description text of the
previous item.  A common use of this item is with
<code>Before=&lt;hr></code> to put a horizontal rule before the menu item.
</dl>
NOTE:  When using extended syntax in the <code>.cap/filename</code> file, be sure and put
the new items after any existing Gopher items.  Many gopher clients
abort their parsing of the <code>.cap</code> file when they reach an unknown
keyword.  Thus, all standard Gopher keywords should come first,
followed by the extended <i>gopherhttpd</i> keywords.

<h1>Putting .cap information into the About file</h1>
As mentioned in a previous section, you can use a file called
<code>filename.about.html</code>, where <code>filename</code> is the
name of the Gopher file or directory, to specify the description that
appears under the menu item.  This is just the default use for the
About file -- you can do much more.  If a line in the About file doesn't start with
<code>keyword=</code>, then it is assumed to be a line in the menu
description.  A single line in this file is equivalent to putting a
<code>Desc=description</code> line in the .cap file.
<p>
However, in the About file (the <code>filename.about.html</code>
file), you can specify multiple description lines.  In the HTML
output, a <code>&lt;dd></code> is inserted at the beginning of each line to force a
line break in the description.
<p>
You can also put any valid <code>.cap</code> information into the About file.  Any
information specified in the About file will override information in
the <code>.cap</code> file.  This allows you to further modify and customize your
WWW page since you can change the Gopher information in the
<i>gopherhttpd</i> About file for a given menu entry.

<h1>Some real examples</h1>
Let's look at a real-life examples where we make use of some of these
advanced features.

<h2>Separating menu items into sections</h2>
In order to organize a Gopher menu into sections, sometimes you will see
gopher sites do this:
<hr>
<pre>
                  Internet Gopher Information Client 2.0 pl10
 
                      Root gopher server: gopher.lanl.gov

</pre>
<hr>
<p>
What we want the WWW home page to look like is something like this:
<hr>
<dl>
<dt>News Flash 7-Mar-1994: What's New in the LANL Gopher....
<p>
<dt>LANL Information
<dl>
<dt>News and Events

<dt>The Internet via Gopher/Mosaic
<dt>Finding People, Places, and Information
<dt>Selected Software Archives (FTP)
<dt>Network News (USENET)
</dl>
</dl>
<hr>
The way to achieve this is to override the <code>Name</code> of the
section headings using the About file.  Let's concentrate on the menu
item titled "LANL Information".  This Gopher menu item points to a
file of information about LANL, with a filename of <code>lanl</code>.
Here is the contents of the <code>.cap/lanl</code> Gopher file:
<pre>
Name=---------------------LANL Information---------------------
Numb=2
</pre>
Pretty simple.  Now, here is the contents of the
<code>lanl.about.html</code> file used by <i>gopherhttpd</i>:
<pre>
Name=LANL Information
Desc=&lt;dl>
Before=&lt;p>
</pre>
The <code>Name=</code> line overrides the Gopher name that contains
all of the hyphens.  The <code>Desc=&lt;dl></code> line
tells HTML to start a new description list for the following menu
items.  
The <code>Before=</code> line adds some space between the previous menu
item and the current one.
<i>gopherhttpd</i> will automatically create a link to the existing
<code>lanl</code> Gopher file.  If you want, you could create an HTML
version of this file called <code>lanl.html</code>, and the link would
automatically point to the HTML file rather than the ASCII file.  

<h2>Creating a WWW-only menu item</h2>
We have seen how you create a Gopher-only menu item;  simply create a
file called <code>.cap/filename.ignore</code> and <i>gopherhttpd</i> will omit the
item from the menu listing.  However, what if you only want a
particular item to appear in the WWW page, and not the Gopher page?
<p>
To create a new WWW-only menu item, simply create a
<code>filename.about.html</code> file.  For example, Let's say we want
to add a menu item that points to the master list of WWW servers.
Obviously we don't want our Gopher users to see this, since it
contains a list of WWW servers, not Gopher servers.  We create a file
called <code>www-list.about.html</code> with the following contents:
<pre>
Name=Master list of WWW servers around the world
Numb=10
WWW=http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/Overview.html
Desc=A listing of registered World-Wide-Web servers maintained at CERN
</pre>
The <code>Name=</code> line specifies the highlighted text of the menu
item.  The <code>Numb=</code> line specifies that this item appears in
tenth place in the menu.  Without the <code>WWW=</code> line,
<i>gopherhttpd</i> would create a link to a file called <code>www-list</code>
or <code>www-list.html</code>.  By overridding this link, we can point
to the server list at CERN instead.  Finally, the <code>Desc=</code>
line adds a short annotation for this menu item.

<h1>Some LANL-specific features</h1>
<i>gopherhttpd</i> also supports some more exotic features that are used at
LANL.  By modifying the perl code for <i>gopherhttpd</i>, you can probably
make use of these features at your own site.  However, feel free to
<a href="#Installing">skip</a> this section if you'd like.

<h2>Linking author entries with the phone book</h2>
The file <code>AUTHOR.html</code> is used to sign the bottom of each
WWW page.  If the file does not exist in the current Gopher directory,
or in any parent directories, default information from the <i>gopherhttpd</i>
configuration file is used.  This file can contain any HTML code.
However, if the file contains a single line with the syntax:
<pre>
text,nnnnnn
</pre>
or
<pre>
nnnnnn:{text}
</pre>
where <code>nnnnnn</code> is a six-digit number, then <i>gopherhttpd</i>
automatically creates a link to the LANL phone book.  The
<code>text</code> will be highlighted, and linked to the following
URL:
<pre>
http://www.lanl.gov:52271/?-l+nnnnnn
</pre>
The LANL phone book runs on port 52271 and takes a query.  The
<code>-l</code> tells the LANL phone book to output the long form of
the record, and the 6-digit number represents the LANL employee
number.

<h2>Creating a local list of servers</h2>
When we started to create a master list of all Gopher and WWW servers
at LANL, we realized that much of the effort spent writing HTML code
could be automated.  After all, what we wanted was a menu of servers,
much like one of our Gopher menus.  The difference is that we wanted
to add some extra information to each item, like the status of the
server, the name of the contact, etc.  We could have just used the
Description capability already build into <i>gopherhttpd</i>, but we decided
to add some more extensions to make it even easier.  The following
additional keywords were added to the <code>.cap/filename</code> and 
<code>filename.about.html</code> file syntax.
<dl>
<dt><code>Status</code>
<dd>Specifies the status of the server (under construction, production,
etc.).  This field can contain any HTML code.  The presence of the
Status keyword in the .cap or About file triggers the code in
<i>gopherhttpd</i> that produces the special format of this menu item.
<dt><code>Admin</code>
<dd>Specifies the contact person in charge of the server.  It can
contain plain HTML text, or it can contain links to the LANL phone
book using the syntax:
<pre>
nnnnnn:{text of first contact},nnnnnn:{text of second contact}...
</pre>
Each contact will be placed on a separate line.
<dt><code>GopherLink</code>
<dd>Normally, the link to the Gopher server will be taken from
the <code>Host</code>, <code>Port</code>, <code>Path</code> keywords.  You can override this using the
<code>GopherLink</code> keyword.  In particular, you can use a value of
<code>none</code> if the system is not running a Gopher server.
<dt><code>WebLink</code>
<dd>Normally, the link to the WWW server will be taken from the <code>Host</code>,
<code>Port</code>, and <code>Path</code> keywords, possibly overriden with the <code>WWW</code> keyword.  You
can override this with the <code>WebLink</code> keyword.  In particular, you can
use a value of <code>none</code> if the system is not running a WWW
server.
</dl>
Let's take a look at an example of a <code>.cap</code> file for a system running
both a Gopher and WWW server, and how <i>gopherhttpd</i> formats this entry:
<hr>
<pre>
Name=DOE High Performance Computing Research Center (ACL)
Type=1
Host=gopher.acl.lanl.gov
Port=70
Status=production
Path=
WWW=http://www.acl.lanl.gov/Home.html
Admin=102733:{Jerry DeLapp (jgd@acl.lanl.gov), Gopher}\n114212:{Ron Daniel (rdaniel@acl.lanl.gov), WWW}
Desc=Information about the Advanced Computing Laboratory and all of the projects that they are involved in.  ACL staff and facilities information.  Link to central LANL server.
</pre>
<hr>
<p>
<i>gopherhttpd</i> displays this menu item like this:
<hr>
<dl>
<dt><a href="http://www.acl.lanl.gov/Home.html">
DOE High Performance Computing Research Center (ACL)</a>
<dd><code>Status...</code>production
<dd><code>WWW......</code><a href="http://www.acl.lanl.gov/Home.html">http://www.acl.lanl.gov/Home.html</a>
<dd><code>Gopher...</code><a href="gopher://gopher.acl.lanl.gov/">gopher://gopher.acl.lanl.gov/</a>
<dd><code>Admin....</code><a href="http://www.lanl.gov:52271/?-l+102733">Jerry DeLapp (jgd@acl.lanl.gov), Gopher</a>
<dd><code>.........</code><a href="http://www.lanl.gov:52271/?-l+114212">Ron Daniel (rdaniel@acl.lanl.gov), WWW</a>
<dl><dd><dd>Information about the Advanced Computing Laboratory and all of the projects that they are involved in.  ACL staff and facilities information.  Link to central LANL server.</dl>
</dl>
<hr>
Note that all of the links are created for you so that in addition to
providing information about the server, you can actually jump to their
WWW server, Gopher server, or phone book entries.
<p>
If you put this information into the Gopher <code>.Links</code> file, rather than
using a <code>.cap</code> file, you will end up with menu items in your Gopher server.
At LANL, we put entries in the <code>.Links</code> file for all servers running
Gopher, then create individual <code>filename.about.html</code> files
for servers that do not run Gopher.  This way, Gopher users see a list
of all LANL Gopher servers, and WWW users see a nice annotated list of
all Gopher and WWW servers at the Lab.

<A NAME="Installing"><h1>Installing <i>gopherhttpd</i></h1></A>
Installation of <i>gopherhttpd</i> is very similar to the installation of a
Gopher server.  <i>gopherhttpd</i> is meant to be run from the Unix <code>inetd</code>
daemon.  Here are the steps involved in installation:
<ol>
<li>Add an entry to your <code>/etc/services</code> file for your new
WWW server.  This entry should look something like:
<pre>
httpd   80/tcp      # WWW server
</pre>
<li>Add an entry to your <code>/etc/inetd.conf</code> file.  This
entry should look something like:
<pre>
http  stream  tcp  nowait  nobody  /etc/gopherhttpd gopherhttpd /gopher /etc/gopherhttpd.conf
</pre>
The meaning of the parameters will be listed in the next section.
Note that this daemon is run as user <code>nobody</code>.  This is recommended as a
security precaution to prevent someone from gaining root access
through unknown holes in <i>gopherhttpd</i>.  This example is taken from a Sun
Sparcstation.  Some Unix systems do not allow you to specify the user
id that your server runs as.
<li>Restart your inetd daemon.  Use
<pre>
ps -ax | grep inetd
</pre>
to determine the process id of <code>inetd</code>.  Then issue a <code>kill
-1 pid</code> to restart it.
</ol>
The above example assumes you put the <i>gopherhttpd</i> code and
configuration file into your <code>/etc</code> directory.  Feel free to use any
directory you wish, and simply update the entry in <code>inetd.conf</code> to reflect
the actual location of these files. 
<a href="file://ftp.lanl.gov/pub/unix/www/gopherhttpd/gopherhttpd">Here
is the source for <i>gopherhttpd</i></a>
<p>
<i>gopherhttpd</i> is written in perl.  perl is an interpreted language that
requires a run-time interpreter.  The first line in <i>gopherhttpd</i> points
to the location of the perl interpreter.  The default location is
<code>/usr/bin/perl</code>.  If your perl interpreter is located in a
different place, change the first line in <i>gopherhttpd</i>.  If you don't
have PERL, 
<a href="http://www.lanl.gov/software/unix/perl">go get it!</a>
No Unix system should be without it.

<h2>Command line parameters</h2>
<i>gopherhttpd</i> takes two parameters on the command line.  The first
parameter is the directory where your Gopher files are located.  This
should be the same as the home directory specified when loading your
Gopher server.
<p>
The second parameter is the location of the <i>gopherhttpd</i> configuration
file.  The contents of this configuration file are very similar to the
contents of your Gopher configuration file.  In particular, it
contains information about MIME file types, access control lists, and
miscellaneous information such as the node and port of your Gopher and
WWW servers.  The 
<a href="file://ftp.lanl.gov/pub/unix/www/gopherhttpd/gopherhttpd.conf">
sample configuration file</a> is full of comments that
explain each parameter.

<h1>Security Considerations</h1>
<i>gopherhttpd</i> acts much like the browse option available in other WWW
servers.  This means that you don't have to provide a specific file
name to <i>gopherhttpd</i>, but can simply give it a directory name and
browse the files in that directory.  <i>gopherhttpd</i> will allow access to
any world-readable file or directory within your Gopher hierarchy.  It
will also follow any symbolic links contains in that hierarchy.  It
will not otherwise allow access outside of the tree specified as the
first parameter to the server.

<h2>Access Control</h2>
<i>gopherhttpd</i> implements the same type of node-based access control as
does the UMN Gopher server.  In the <i>gopherhttpd</i> configuration file,
you add lines of the form:
<pre>
access: ip-address  access
</pre>
where <code>ip-address</code> is the full or partial IP address of the
system of network you want to control access on.  <code>access</code>
is either a + or - to allow or deny access.  If the access field is
any string beginning with an exclamation mark (!), access is denied,
any other string not beginning with an ! allows access.  The second
form of the syntax makes the configuration file compatible with
existing gopher configuration files.
<p>
The ip-address field can actually be any Unix regular expression.
Periods (.) not followed by a * or + are automatically escaped.
Missing fields in the IP address are filled with .* automatically.
Thus, the ip-address <code>128.165</code> expands to the regular
expression <code>128\.165\..*\..*</code>, matching any node beginning
with the specified numbers.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
Running <i>gopherhttpd</i> in addition to a Gopher server makes your
information available to the widest possible audience.  The defaults
are designed to get your system up and running as quickly and easily
as possible.  Many customization hooks are provided that allow you to
fine tune to look of your WWW pages using HTML.  Using the Gopher
directory hierarchy forces the system administrator to organize their
information.  The system administrator doesn't need to write HTML code
in order to generate nice looking menus.  Until everyone starts
generating their information directly in HTML, using
<i>gopherhttpd</i> is a good compromise between the Gopher ASCII information
and the WWW HTML information, giving you the advantages of both systems.
