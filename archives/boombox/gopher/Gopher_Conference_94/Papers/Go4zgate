                    Accessing Library Catalogs Using Go4zgate

                               Neophytos Iacovou

          While Gopher has had a gateway to WAIS (an extension of the 
          1988 revision of Z39.50) for several years, Z39.50 has not
          been standing still. The new 1992 revision of Z39.50 requires
          a new gopher gateway and this allows for access to online
          catalogs. This paper describes Go4zgate - a gopher to 1992
          Z39.50 gateway.

                                April 13, 1994



1.0 Introduction
    At the moment a student can access the University of Minnesota's library 
system by either: walking up to any one of the public access terminals found in
every library on campus; or they can open a telnet/TN3270 session to the 
libraries's mainframes. In either case the result is the same, the student is 
greeted with a what can only be described as "clunky" user-interface. 

    The University of Minnesota library system has embraced Z39.50 and is 
beginning to move away from its current mainframe/terminal architecture to a 
client/server architecture. As this transition occurs the opportunity to give
the students a better user-interface exists.

    Z39.50 is a NISO standard; its official name is "Information Retrieval 
Application Service Definition and Protocol Specification for Open Systems 
Interconnection". Z39.50 is currently at version 2, the planned release date of
version 3 is currently set for the fall of 1994. 

    A Gopher to Z39.50 version 2 gateway (Go4zgate) was developed in order to 
allow students to access the various Z39.50 databases currently available. At 
the present time these databases are generally on-line library catalogs, but as
more and more people become familiar with Z39.50 the expected number of 
available Z39.50 servers will increase.

    The rest of this paper describes Go4zgate and how it can be used to access
on-line library catalogs.


2.0 Why Use Go4zgate?
    The benefits of accessing Z39.50 library catalogs via Go4zgate are: 

    ·   Users don't have to learn a new IR system, they are already familiar
        with Gopher.

    ·   The interface is kept simple and does not assume the user to be a 
        "library catalog power user".

    ·   As the user moves from catalog to catalog (potentially from site to 
        site) she is not forced to learn a new command set, the Go4zgate 
        interface remains the same.


3.0 An Example Session

    The following is a walk through of what a typical Z39.50 session might 
look like:

    Selecting the desired library catalog to search the user is greeted with a
screen asking her to create a query by providing the appropriate data for each
of the 3 search fields. At least one of the search fields must be filled in. 
To keep the user-interface simple all 3 search fields are tied together by a 
boolean "AND" operation. Go4zgate can also handle an "OR" operation across all
fields as well.

    The interface to this Z39.50 database creates queries based on the Title, 
Author, and Subject fields. Had the user not been searching a library catalog 
but rather a database on cars, the fields from which the query was to be 
created could just as easily have been Make, Model, and Year. The MaxRecs field
prompts the user for the maximum number of records to return from the search.

Being a William S. Burroughs fan this user does a search on _Interzone_.

    Selecting any one of the returned records will display the record in its 
"long" format. One thing to notice about this format is that information 
concerning the book's availability and location within the library are not 
shown. The reason for this is that holdings information is currently not a part
of the Z39.50 standard. This information will be included in version 3 of the 
standard.

    Another thing to note is the "Other authors" field. Z39.50 queries 
involving the Author are also checked with the "Other authors" field. This may
confuse people are first, records will be returned even though the specified
author is not the principle author. However, this feature also accounts for 
anthologies in which the work of the specified author may appear.

    The first record returned is actually a pseudo record and is created by 
Go4zgate. By selecting this record the user is allowed to view the long format
of all the records returned. This comes in handy particularly when the result
of a query produces more than a handful of records. Without this feature the
user would be forced to manually open each and every record in order to gain
the same information. Users will also want to save/download this record.

                        FIGURE 4.   All Records Returned



    This record also supplies the user with some information regarding her 
request.  In this example case the user is told that her query produced 5 
records, of which 5 were returned. This feature is useful because often a query
may produce more records than were requested by MaxRecs. In such a case the 
user can then decide if she wants to rerun the query with a higher value for
the maximum number of records to be returned.


4.0 Exactly What Information Is Returned?
    Currently the following fields are displayed to the user: Author, Title, 
Publisher, Pages, Series, Notes, Subjects, Other authors, and Call Numbers. 
The Call Numbers field can be a bit misleading. Most libraries stopped 
populating the Call Number field ever since they started to store information
about a book in its Holdings Record. Because of this the information in the 
Call Number field may not always be valid. In the best case there is no 
information available in the field, or any information present is accurate. In
the worst case the information shown in the field is old and out-dated.

    In the future, besides returning ASCII text Z39.50 queries may display 
images or play sounds. These additions are scheduled to find their way into
version 3 of the standard.


5.0 Future plans

    At the moment the only boolean operation applied is an "AND" or an "OR",
and this is applied across all of the search fields. Future plans involve 
allowing for boolean operations to be applied within a search field. As an 
example, the user who previously searched for Interzone would have to issue 
another query in order to find information about Queer. It would be nice if she
could specify something in the order of: "Interzone" AND "Queer".

    We also plan on following the development of Z39.50 and implement changes
in the standard in order to keep the gateway as useful as can be.


6.0 Technical Details

6.1 Internet Gopher and the Gopher Protocol
    Internet Gopher is an information system used to publish and organize 
information on servers distributed across the Internet. Initially developed at
the University of Minnesota in early 1991, it has spread to over 4800 sites
worldwide as of December 1993.

    The Gopher system is a client-server system that can be used to build a
Campus Wide Information System (CWIS). Clients, which browse and search
information are available for most major platforms (Macintosh, DOS, Windows,
Unix, VMS, MVS, VM/CMS, OS/2). Servers, which translate and publish
information, are also available for all of the platforms mentioned above.

    This client-server architecture uses the Internet Gopher Protocol. The
Gopher protocol has been described as "brutally simple." It is based on a
web/tree metaphor of files and directories. Its basic primitives are a list
directory transaction, a retrieve file transaction and a search for directory
entries transaction.


6.2 The Z39.50 Architecture
    The last page of this paper contains a diagram illustrating a typical
Z39.50 architecture. 

    The Z39.50 server may have one or more on-line catalogs available. The 
name of the catalog to be searched must be provided along with the query sent
to the server. 

    Because Z39.50 is a client/server protocol the user's client must make a
connection to the Z39.50 server, make a request, and await for the output. 
Go4zgate was developed because Gopher clients aren't force to speak Z39.50ish;
therefore, they require a translator who understands both Gopher+ and Z39.50
version 2. Go4zgate resides between the Gopher+ client and the Z39.50 server.

    The interface between the user and Go4zgate is a Gopher+ ASK form. This
makes creating new interfaces fast and simple.

    The Gopher client, Go4zgate, and the Z39.50 server are all connected 
together via the Information Super Highway.


6.3 What Does the Ask Form Look Like?


Note:            Search University of California's Melvyl Library System  
Note: 
Ask: Title
Ask: Author
Ask: Subject
Ask: MaxRecs    10
Note: 
Note:                   (enter 1 or more of the search fields)                  



    As you can see a rather simple form is used. Note that because MaxRecs must
be supplied a value a default number of 10 is supplied for the user. This of
course can be changed. If no value is provided by the user the query will not
be attempted and the user will be informed that invalid input has been 
provided.

    This interface can be easily expanded as well. If you recall we had i
previously mentioned that all three of the search fields are tied together by a
boolean "AND" operation, and that an "OR" operation was also valid. Because
some users may want to decide between the two choices it is possible to add
the following line to the above script in order to provide this service:

        Choose: Operation:   AND OR

    In the ASK form shown above this is not an option because it adds another
variable which may confuse users. This is not to say that it is never going to
be presented to users as an option to control. Below is an example of what a
form with more user-specified options might look like:

6.4 What Goes on After the User Has Completed the Form?


#!/usr/local/bin/perl

$Title = <>; chop ($Title);
$Author = <>; chop ($Author);
$Subject = <>; chop ($Subject);
$Mrecs = <>; chop ($Mrecs);

$Title =~ s/[^A-Za-z0-9 ]//g;
$Author =~ s/[^A-Za-z0-9 ]//g;
$Subject =~ s/[^A-Za-z0-9 ]//g;
$Mrecs =~ s/[^0-9 ]//g;

$Host = "melvyl.ucop.edu";
$Catalog = "CATALOG";
$Port = "210";

$Operator = "AND";
$Gopher_host = "mudhoney.micro.umn.edu";
$Gopher_port = "70";
$MyPID = $$;
$longdir = 0;
$Binary_Path1 = "/export/mudhoney/gopher-data/gplustest/ask/di/go4zgate";
$Binary_Path2 = "/gplustest/ask/di/go4zgate_shell";
$longdir = 1 if ($ENV{"CONTENT_TYPE"} eq "application/gopher+-menu");

system "$Binary_Path1 -I $longdir -h $Host -c $Catalog -p $Port -o $Operator -m
\"$Mrecs\" -T \"$Title\" -A \"$Author\" -S \"$Subject\" -M $MyPID -B $Binary_Pat
h2 -H $Gopher_host -P $Gopher_port";



    The above code is a perl script which processes the information entered
into the form. As you can see Operator is preset to an AND operation. Included
in this script are preset values for Host (which is set to melvyl.ucop.edu for
this particular form), the Catalog, and the Z39.50 port (Port). On thing to
note, most servers will be listening to Z39.50 requests on port 210, but this
may not always be so. 

    The only other variable which is interesting to look at is "longdir". This
variable tells Go4zgate if it should return information using the long dir.
format or not. As an example, the cursors version of the Gopher client will
request for long dir. listings, TurboGopher (the Macintosh Gopher client) will
not. 

    One final word, as you make changes to the ASK form (i.e., by adding
options such as allowing the user to select by which boolean operator the
search fields are bound) you will also have to make changes to this script. 


6.5 A Few Words on Go4zgate itself
    You may have noticed that the above script does not apply any error checks
on the input provided by the user. All of that is done within the gateway
software itself. Rest assured that invalid options are checked for and an error
message is returned to the user. Invalid input includes: a value of 0, or less,
or NULL for MaxRecs; and NULL data for each of the search fields.

    The smaller the catalog the server is searching through and the easier the
query the user requested is, the faster the gateway is. The bottleneck in terms
of time is, and this shouldn't come as a big surprise, the time required for
the server to execute the query. In order to make life easier for the user,
Go4zgate caches the records returned by the server. This means that once the
request has been fulfilled the user will be able to select and view any of the
returned records relatively fast. If the user tries to retrieve one of the
records returned and, for any reason, the cache has been removed the gateway
will go back to the server and request that the original query be fulfilled -
the original cache will be recreated.


7.0 The Gateway Software
    Parts of the gateway software were written by: Ray Larson at the School of
Library and Information Studies, UC Berkeley, who wrote most of the Z39.50
query engine; Clearinghouse for Networked Information Discovery and Retrieval
(CNIDR), who took the query engine and made a WWW gateway from it; and the
University of Minnesota who took the software from CNIDR and made a Gopher+
gateway, in addition to adding more functions provided for by the query engine
into the gateway.

    The Go4zgate gateway allows the Gopher Client to:

    ·   Request Z39.50 based queries from a Z39.50 server.

    ·   Retrieve and display the records which were returned by the server.

The gateway is available via anonymous ftp from boombox.micro.umn.edu
via anonymous ftp from the directory

        /pub/gopher/Unix/gopher-gateways/go4zgate

Included in this distribution are some sample ASK blocks that define the form
users are presented with. Also included is this document.
