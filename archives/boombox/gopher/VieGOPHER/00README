At the request of Gerhard Gonter, the Vienna Gopher software
for VM/CMS has been removed. A new version of the software ought to 
be available shortly. See below:

Subject: VieGOPHER (aka CMS_Vienna or Vienna_CMS)

Hello,
  please remove the files of the so called Vienna CMS gopher version
  because they are completely outdated now.  In a note from March or April
  someone (Mark?) offered to install a userid/password for me so that
  I can transfer the updates of the code.  If this is not wanted/possible
  I will transfer the upcoming new edition into the incoming area and
  send you a seperate note about this.
   
   Btw:  Please rename the old directory into VieGOPHER (or VieGopher)
   because the package is now know under this name.
    
    thank you for you support and best wishes, Gerhard Gonter
