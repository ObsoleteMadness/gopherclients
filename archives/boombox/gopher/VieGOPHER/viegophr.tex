\begin{abstract}\footnote{This
file is still somewhat ... er ... incomplete ... sorry ...}
The Internet Gopher Protocol provides a simple, yet very effective
method for distributed document search and retrieval.  This document
describes usage, installation, maintainance and also some points 
about the implementation of a Gopher
system for IBM's operating system VM/CMS, called the VieGOPHER.
Both, using the client and administrating the server are discussed.

The system can be distributed freely and is dedicated to the community
of cyberspace.

\section{Introduction}

This document describes an implementation of the Internet GOPHER Server
and Client protocol for IBM's operating system VM/CMS, known as the
`Vienna' VM Gopher System or `VieGOPHER'.
There are things left out and enhancements will follow.  If you find any
errors or have other suggestion then don't hesitate to contact me on one
of the addresses given in section \ref{gg.addr} on page \pageref{gg.addr}.
 
The system consists of a client, based on {\sf XEDIT} ({\tt GOPHERC.EXEC}
together with
a bunch of {\tt .XEDIT} and {\tt .EXEC} files) and two servers,
the older one is a simple,
straight forward, plain vanilla, nothing special, ordinary, single-treaded
Internet Gopher Server\footnote{not supported anymore} ({\tt GOPHERD.EXEC}),
the new one ({\tt GOPHERDD.EXEC}) %\index{GOPHERDD.EXEC}
is just the opposite of that all...  well...  the most interesting feature
of it is that it is multi-threaded.  This means, it can handle more than
one connection at the same time and, in fact, the version I currently run
listens on four ports at the same time and is still able to handle a
couple of connections simultanously.  Since this server listens on four
different ports you might suspect that one is the officially assigned
gopher port (70) and the the other two ports are something else.  This
assumption is not completely wrong, the server also listens on port 79
and pretends to be a finger server as well on port 17 and serves out fortune
cookies.  The service on port 17 is also known as the Quote-of-the-Day
protocol.  Finger protocol (see \cite{rfc1288})
and Quote-of-the-Day protocol (see \cite{rfc865})
are handled by the Gopher Server as a by-product,
as you may have time to read in the code.
 
In order to run either the server or the client you also need a program
called {\tt REXTCPIP.MODULE} (by Ken Hornstein).  You can find it on any
{\sf BITNET LISTSERV} that carries {\sf VM-UTIL}, (e.g. {\sf DEARN}).
Be sure to use version 1.8.4. or newer.  Section \ref{bugs} gives
information about modifications that improve the stability of the
program.  If necessary, a modified version can be obtained from me.
You also need TCPIP to run either the server or the client.
The new server can also employ {\tt YWAKEUP.MODULE} to trap messages
from servicing machines.

Clients running under TCPIP version 2 can take advantage of RXSOCKET
instead of REXTCPIP.  RXSOCKET is generally more elaborate and
stable, either version 1 or can be used.

The instability of REXTCPIP is the main weaknes of the server.
To overcome this problem I work along three paths:
\begin{enumerate}
\item   I try to make the REXX code of the server as shock-proof
        as possible,
\item   I try to correct some of the problems inherent in
        REXTCPIP, see section \ref{bugs} for a documentation
        about some of the patches sofar,
\item   allowing to select RXSOCKET seems to be the most
        promising path in the long run.
\end{enumerate}
 


\subsection{Features}

\noindent Client:
\noindent\begin{itemize}
\item can work with WAIS search gateways
\item convenient XEDIT interface
\end{itemize}

\noindent Server:
\noindent\begin{itemize}
\item multiple connections
\item integrated finger server
\item integrated cookie server
\item interface for embedded applications
\end{itemize}

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 


\subsection{{\sc Rose} installation procedure}

The source code of the programs and the parts of the \LaTeX\ documentation
are stored together in NED's HYX format --- NED is a MSDOS `hypertexty'
text editor.  From this source three text files are generated:
\begin{itemize}
\item   {\tt VIEGOPHR.PRO(DUCT)} containing the program code,
\item   {\tt VIEGOPHR.TEX} containing the documentation,
        (this document)
\item   {\tt VIEG-PRO.TEX} containing the source code listing.
\end{itemize}

{\tt VIEGOPHR.PRODUCT} needs to be processed by {\tt ROSE.EXEC}.
{\sc Rose} is not part of VieGOPHER, however, it was developed
for it's installation.
The program can be distributed freely just as the other
package.  

% To install VieGOPHER using {\sc Rose} these conditions should be met:
% $\Box$ the files {\tt ROSE.EXEC} and {\tt VIEGOPHR.PRODUCT} in
% read access on any minidisk.  A read/write minidisk as A with at
% least XXX free blocks.  If you have the $\Box$ optional file
% {\tt VIEGOPHR.FIX}, possibly from an earlier experience with {\sc Rose},
% then you should place it now on minidisk A.  Note:  This file
% will be changed or created during installation.

\subsubsection{Quick'n'dirty installation}

Appendix \ref{inst.opts} on page \pageref{inst.opts} lists all {\sc Rose}
prompt texts that will be presented during the installation phase.

\noindent
Use this checklist to get the system off the ground:
\begin{itemize}
\item[1 $\Box$] Put {\tt VIEGOPHR.PRODCUT} and {\tt ROSE.EXEC}
                on any readable minidisk.

\item[2 $\Box$] Prepare a R/W minidisk with filemode A with at
                least 2 cylinders (275 blocks with 4096 byte).

\item[3 $\Box$] If you have {\tt VIEGOPHR.FIX} around somewhere,
                you can place it on minidisk A, but this is not necessary.

\item[4 $\Box$] Start the program generator by entering:
                {\tt ROSE VIEGOPHR}

\item[5 $\Box$]  Read the options presented by {\sc Rose} and answer the questions
        appropriately.  In most cases you will want to use the
        predefined option.  In this case simply enter code 1 or hit
        the ENTER key.  If you want to change something enter code 3
        (followed by pressing the ENTER key of course) and then enter
        the value that you want to use.

\item[6 $\Box$]  After prompting for all options {\sc Rose} will generate all
        modules and invoke the postinstallation procedure {\tt GOPHINST.EXEC}.

\item[7 $\Box$]  Fetch any missing file that the postinstallion procedure might
        point out.  If the postinstallation procedure finds
        inconstencies in your installation, remove the appropriate
        line from {\tt VIEGOPHR.FIX} and go back to step 4.

\item[8 $\Box$]  Put the file {\tt VIEGOPHR.FIX} at a safe place.  You might want
        to use it again for a fast re-installation later on.

\item[9 $\Box$]  Place {\tt RXSOCKET.MODULE} and/or {\tt REXTCPIP.MODULE} on minidisk A.

\item[10 $\Box$]  Done!  Your minidisk A should now contain all necessary programs 
        for the client and server.

\item[11 $\Box$]  If you don't want the server you can remove {\tt GOPHERDD.EXEC}.

\item[12 $\Box$]  If you want to run the server it's time to look through
        this document ({\tt VIEGOPHR.PS}) now to find out about
        index files, access groups, etc...

\subsection{Client Modules}

The client is based on {\sf XEDIT} and {\sf REXTCPIP} or {\sf RXSOCKET}.
It does not
require any other non-standard extensions of the operating system, like
{\sf CMS-PIPES} and should also work with TCP/IP release 1 (the
REXTCPIP version only).




\subsection{General Module Layout}

 


\subsubsection{Modules from other Sources}
 
The files {\tt REXTCPIP.MODULE} and {\tt RXSOCKET.MODULE}
alternatively provide the network transport system.
 
TCP/IP must be available to the user; the TCPIP public disk is not
required unless the user also wants to use TELNET.

\subsubsection{Quick Installation}

Installing the VieGOPHER client quickly is fairly easy:  Just get the
distribution package\footnote{see appendix \ref{sources} how to obtain it},
and follow the installation procedures given in the readme file (or
in the introduction),
get {\tt REXTCPIP.MODULE} version 1.8.4 or {\tt RXSOCKET.MODULE},
put everything on your minidisk, and type {\tt GOPHER}.
If everything is ok you should get the root menu of the server
{\tt gopher.wu-wien.ac.at}\footnote{Figure \ref{run.cl1} on page
\pageref{run.cl1} shows such a menu}, otherwise you have a problem.
% and you should consider reading the upcomming section about
% professional installation.



\SUBsection{Using the Client}

The gopher client is invoked by executing GOPHER.  If everything is set up
properly, the root menu of your default server should appear within a
few seconds.  Figure \ref{run.cl1} shows a root menu.  The beginning of
a menu line contains an item marker, {\tt $<$F$>$} indicates a text file
and {\tt $<$D$>$} indicates another menu or directory.
Table \ref{supported.items} lists all item types that are supported
by this client.  Please note that other servers might also provide
different item types, these are flagged by a marker of the form
{\tt $>$}{\sl{x}}{\tt{$<$}}.  A list of other know item types is provided
in table \ref{supported.items}.

\SUBsubsection{Programmable Function Keys}

Basically, the user interface is `pure' {\sf XEDIT} with a customized
PF-key setting.  How the keys are set up is shown in table \ref{PF.keys}.

PF11    & {\tt Display}     & display item of line where cursor is currently\\
PF12    & {\tt Circle}      & switch to next active item                    \\

PF15    & {\tt Exit}        & leave Gopher immediately                      \\
PF16    &                   & {\it unassigned yet, reserved ***}            \\
\hline
PF17    & {\tt Split}       & split the screen                              \\

PF20    & {\tt PageDN}      & go one page forward (down)                    \\
\hline
PF21    & {\tt ShowRing}    & show active items in XEDIT ring               \\

\hline\hline
ENTER   &                   & display item of line where cursor currently is\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}




PF24 triggers execution of general editor commands just like the ENTER
key would do during a normal XEDIT session while the ENTER key has the
same function as PF11, that is displaying the selected item.
Activating the {\tt Display} function will make the
Gopher client fetch the item described by the line of the menu where
the cursor is currently in, the result is then displayed as a new XEDIT
file. The file containing the menu is then still active, each fetched
item adds another file to a so-called XEDIT file ring.

Leaving a file with the {\tt GoBack} function ({\tt PF3}) causes that file
to be removed from the editor ring and XEDIT will select another file from
the ring for display.

This kind of behaviour might lead the user to a tree-like view of the
data space.  In reality --- whatever that term means --- is the user
confronted with a quite chaotic, only partially tree like data space.
One of the main features of the gopher protocol is the ability to point
to other servers.  Thus most servers point to the central node in the
world-wide gopher network, {\tt boombox.micro.umn.edu}, this server also
maintains a list of other known gopher servers.  The result is a circle
of servers pointing to each other, back and forth.



\SUBsubsection{File Ring}

The XEDIT file ring and the insertion and deletion strategy work like
Ariadne's Thread.  However, the {\tt Circle} function allows the user
to activate the next file in the editor file ring without quitting the
current file.  The function {\tt ShowRing} (PF20) gives you a list of
items in the XEDIT ring, you can select any item by placing the cursor
in the appropriate line and pressing ENTER or PF11.  All in all, the
XEDIT ring system is a perfect way to loose orientation in the
Gopher-maze...  What was it that I wanted to explain now?  Ah yes,
bookmarks!



\SUBsubsection{Bookmarks ({\tt BMK})}

After exploring Gopher Space for a while you will realize, that an
enormous quantity of information is out there.  But where exactly
did you see that particular piece of invaluable information?  You could
write down it's `coordinates'.  By the way, coordinates in Gopher Space
are three components that are found in a normal Gopher directory or menu:
server name, port number and selector string.  The item type is useful
for your client to know how a particular item should be presented, the
fifth component of a directory is only of interest for the user, it is
the so-called `display string' or name and should give you a clue about
what you can expect from a particular item.

VieGOPHER, like most other Gopher clients, allows you to take notes about
the coordinates of an item you found.  This is usually called a bookmark,
because it leads you back to the place where you found the information
and is not a reproduction of the information itself.
You can either take a bookmark for the item that is currently displayed
(PF4) or you could request that the item which is in the menu line of the
cursor should be transfered to the bookmark list (PF5).  The list of your
bookmarks is stored in a file named {\tt GOPHER.BOOKMARK} and can be
activated by pressing PF6 (the BMK function).  The bookmark file is then
read and the file is added to the XEDIT file ring.

\noindent Notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item   Save the bookmark file after modifying (editing) it using
        the FILE command.
\item   Be careful about activating and editing the bookmark file
        and taking more bookmarks while the bookmark file is still
        active in the XEDIT file ring.
\item   Save bookmarks for WAIS search items from the menu.
\end{itemize}



\SUBsubsection{Saving items to a file}

Text items can be stored in local files for later processing or printing.
This is done by pressing PF9 (save) when displaying the text item
of interest.  The text will be appended to the file {\tt GOPHER.SAVEFILE},
together with a short header listing the gopher coordinates of the item.
  Of course, the XEDIT commands {\tt SAVE}, {\tt FILE},
and {\tt PUT} can be entered on the command line as normal.



\SUBsubsection{Telnet}

VieGOPHER supports the telnet types 8 for `normal' telnet and T for
Telnet 3270.  IBM's {\tt TELNET.MODULE} is able to handle both types,
so the client will call this program by default.

It may be desireable,
however, to configure another program to handle type 8 or type T
sessions.  This can be done either at configuration time by specifying
appropriate values for the ROSE-variables {\tt CL\_TELNET\_8} and
{\tt CL\_TELNET\_T}.

The user can overide this selections by assigning the programs he
desires to the global variables {\tt TELNET-8} and {\tt TELNET-T},
both are in the group {\tt GOPHER}.

Please note, the ROSE-variables and the global variables must specify
the complete name of the desired program.  For example, a user would
use VieGOPHER's SETUP function or
enter the following command to setup Arty Ecock's VT100 telnet emulator
for `normal' telnet sessions:

\begin{verbatim}
GLOBALV SELECT GOPHER SETLP TELNET-8 TNVT100 EXEC
\end{verbatim}



\SUBsection{Supported Item Types}

Table \ref{supported.items} list all currently supported item
types.  Please be aware, some servers know item types that this
client will not be able to process, other item types (like {\tt w})
are not yet standardized and might be interpreted differently by
the server on one side and the client on the other side.

\SUBsection{Global Variables}

  The client uses two different types of global variables, permanent
  ones, for storing setup parameters, in the file {\tt LASTING.GLOBALV}
  and temporary ones in memory.
 
 


\SUBsubsection{User Setup}

Table \ref{clglv} on page \pageref{clglv} lists all the
global variables that are used by the client.
They are in the group GOPHER in the file {\tt LASTING.GLOBALV}
and can be modified with the SETUP function built into the
client (PF23: {\tt Setup}) or by calling the program GOPHSTP.

%%% this part is obsolete already ... %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%\noindent {\bf Attention:}
%%% {\tt HOST}, {\tt ITYPE} and {\tt SEL}
%%%     need to be set, accessed and modified using
%%%     {\tt GLOBALVV.EXEC} since they will usually contain mixed
%%%     case strings which can't be handled with GLOBALV.

\SUBsection{Files}

  There are no files read in normal operation.  For direct access without
  TCP/IP, the local fetching option ({\tt CL\_USE\_LOCALFETCH}) must be
  turned on and all the files visible to the server must also be visible
  to the client, especially the selector file, the group file, and the
  root index.
 


\subsection{Calling {\tt GOPHFTCH.EXEC}}

The heart of the VieGOPHER client, the item fetcher {\tt GOPHFTCH.EXEC}
is a program of it's own right and can be embedded in other applications
as well.  It's calling formats are:\\
\rule{0mm}{1mm}

\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{l|l|}\cline{2-2}
1. & \verb#GOPHFTCH ofn oft ofm[(fm_opt] type host port path#     \\ \cline{2-2}
2. & \verb#GOPHFTCH ofn oft ofm[(fm_opt] FILE ifn ift ifm#        \\ \cline{2-2}
3. & \verb#GOPHFTCH ofn oft ofm[(fm_opt] PULL#                    \\ \cline{2-2}
%%%%%%%%%  & \verb#fm_opt := PUSH | QUEUE | XEDIT# \\ \cline{2-2}
\end{tabular}\end{center}

\rule{0mm}{3mm}

In the first format, all Gopher coordinates are specified on the
command line, the second format requires GOPHFTCH to read the coordinates
from the specified file and the third format tells GOPHFTCH that the
coordinates can be pulled from the stack.


\verb#ofn oft ofm# specifies the file where the fetched data should be
written to, unless {\tt fm\_opt} forces the data to be processed otherwise.

\verb#fm_opt#, the filemode options, can be either empty,
{\tt PUSH}, {\tt QUEUE} or {\tt XEDIT}.\\
\rule{0mm}{1mm}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
Option     & Description \\ \hline \hline
           & The empty filemode option indicates that the data should\\
           & indeed be written to the specified outout file. \\ \hline
{\tt PUSH} & indicates that the data will be pushed to the stack. \\ \hline
{\tt QUEUE}& indicates that the data will be queued on the stack. \\ \hline
{\tt XEDIT}& indicates that incoming data should immediately be written\\
           & to the file being edited with XEDIT. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\rule{0mm}{3mm}

\noindent
Please note:
\begin{itemize}
\item   there must be no space between the output filemode, the
        bracket and the actual filemode option!
\item   Please note also, a valid filename for writing must be
        specified in all cases!
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\caption{Format of the data on the stack for options
{\tt PUSH} and {\tt QUEUE}} \label{stack.format}

{\tt +}{\sl more of the long text line}\\
{\tt -}{\sl end of the long text line}\\
{\tt -}{\sl another short text line}\\
{\tt END}%
}}\end{center}
\end{figure}

\noindent
{\sl type} specifies the type of the item to be fetched and controls
the way how GOPHFTCH will process the data.\\
{\sl host} specifies the internet address of the Gopher server's host.\\
{\sl port} specifies the TCP port number where the Gopher server listens.\\
{\sl path} specifies the selector string which GOPHFTCH will send to
the server to request an item.\\
{\sl ifn ift ifm}\ specifies the input file where the necessary Gopher
coordinates can be found.

\begin{figure}
\caption{Format of the Gopher coordinates on file for the FILE-method}

}}\end{center}
\end{figure}

Long path-strings can be segmented into a series of {\tt PATH=} or
{\tt HTAP=} records.  {\tt PATH=} segments are put at the end of
the path string, while {\tt HTAP=} segments are put at the beginning
of the path string.  The {\tt END} record must be present to tell
GOPHFTCH when to stop reading from the stack.

\subsection{Server Modules}

%   * GOPHERDD.EXEC
%   * Modules from other Sources


\subsubsection{Multi-Threaded Multi-Protocol Daemon}
 
The file {\tt GOPHERDD.EXEC} resembles the main module of the server.
This program will also call the modules {\tt FINGERXX.EXEC} to generate
the response for finger queries and {\tt COOKIE.EXEC} to generate
short text messages from a cookie base.
 
 


\subsubsection{Modules from other Sources}

For managing TCP connections, the file {\tt REXTCPIP.MODULE} is used,
trapping control messages from servicing VMs is implemented using
{\tt YWAKEUP.MODULE} or IBM's standard WAKEUP method.
 
TCP/IP must be available to the server, however, access to the TCPIP
public disk is not necessary.
 
 


\subsection{Installation}
 
  The files {\tt GOPHERD.EXEC}\footnote{This program is now obsolete;
  it is still distributed in the package to provide the interested
  reader with some in-depth information.} as well as {\tt GOPHERDD.EXEC}
  have an installation
  section where local parameters should be configured at installation
  time using ROSE.
  There are the definitions of the ports where the servers listen
  and the files that are used by the server modules.
  Figure \ref{conf.gopherdd} shows an example.
 


\begin{figure}

{\tt GOPHERDD.EXEC}}\label{conf.gopherdd}

\end{verbatim}
\end{small}
\end{center}
\rule{0mm}{2mm}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{Virtual Machines}
  The setup used at {\sf awiwuw11.wu-wien.ac.at} is this:  
  the virtual machine {\bf GOPHER} has all the programs on it's minidisk 191,
  accessed as A.  This disk is public to all users.
  Data files are stored on various disks.
  The VM also has a link to GOPHERD.191 as I.

  The VM {\bf GOPHERD} has a link to GOPHER.191 as minidisk B (read-only)
  and all the necessary data disks of GOPHER and other VMs.
  The server module GOPHERDD is started from the profile\footnote{A sample
  profile is shown in section \ref{prof.GOPHERD}.}.  GOPHERD can be forced
  and auto-logged by the VM TCPIP and is currently also forced and
  auto-logged by the VM VMUTIL four times a day.

  Allowing TCPIP to control GOPHERD requires an entry in the file
  PROFILE TCPIP.  Figure \ref{PROFILE.TCPIP} on page \pageref{PROFILE.TCPIP}
  shows an excerpt of that file, listing relevant entries.
  Please note that GOPHERD is mentioned in the AUTOLOG section once and
  three times in the PORT section, where the statements for port
  17 (Quote) and 79 (Finger) are flagged with NOAUTOLOG.  It's not
  clear if it could cause problems when one virtual machine
  has more than one autolog-controlled ports and sofar this setup
  did not reveal any shortcoming.

The server processes a number of files to obtain vital information
for it's operation.  Purpose and format of these files is described
in the following sections.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
\tt GOPHERD.GROUPS    & privileged IP addresses, access groups \\ \hline

\noindent NOTES:
\begin{itemize}
\item   The group {\tt *} is not defined in {\tt GOPHERD.GROUPS}.
        Files refering to group names will use {\tt *} to indicate that
        something is available to everyone on the Internet.
\item   There is a dot ({\tt .}) after subnet addresses and
        that there is no dot after a completely specified host address.
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{{\tt GOPHERD.DSKGRP}}\label{dskgrpfile}

The disk groups file associates file modes (minidisks) with access groups,
as defined in the previously.  This allows the server to quickly decide
if files with a certain file mode can be delivered to a client,
depending on the client's Internet address.

\noindent Format of a disk group file\footnote{For an example
see appendix \ref{example GOPHERD.DSKGRP}.}:\\
\begin{center}
\fbox{{\sl disk priority groupnames}}
\end{center}
An entry line starting with {\tt *}\ or {\tt \#}\ is comment
and ignored.

\noindent {\sl disk} is the file mode for the particular disk.
Please note, {\tt X1} is not treated the same as {\tt X2} etc.

\noindent {\sl priority} when scanning the entries during a run-down,
the file with the highest priority is delivered.  Only files of
priorities larger than 0 are sent out at all.

\noindent {\sl groupnames} is a list of group names defined in the group
file (see \ref{groupfile}).



\subsubsection{{\tt GOPHERD.SELECTOR}}\label{selectorfile}

  This file lists all known selector strings (path names)
  together with associated access group names,
  owner authentication codes, and finally the file name.
  The server checks the requested item in the selector list
  and sends out the contents of the
  associated file if the file has no access restrictions.
  Records have the form...\\
\rule{0mm}{1mm}

\begin{center}
   \fbox{\sl fn.ft.fm ~~~ owner ~~~ group ~~~ selector}

  ft          & file type\\
              & * indicates that the file type is taken from the\\
              & selector string.  This is used to reduce the number\\
              & of entries in the selector file and to have less\\

\end{tabular}

\rule{0mm}{5mm}
 
\noindent  NOTES:
\begin{itemize}
\item   Don't use characters in the selector string which are difficult
        to be processed in the command line.
\item   Group names, owner names as well as selector strings are case
        sensitive.
\item   Owner names have currently no real meaning and are ignored
\item   Note the dotted notation for file names.
\item   Include the file mode in the filename field.
\end{itemize}
 


\subsubsection{{\tt GOPHERD.EAI}}\label{eaifile}

(info is coming up later, remind me... )

Format of the path string (selector):\\
{\tt EAI-}{\sl handle}\fbox{{\tt TAB}}{\sl key-term}

The file \fbox{{\tt GOPHERD.EAI}} defines a relationship between
a selector handle, a privilege group declaration and a method
to call the embedded application.  The format of such a file is:

  \fbox{{\sl handle}\rule{3mm}{0mm}{\sl reserved}\rule{3mm}{0mm}
        {\sl group}\rule{3mm}{0mm}{\sl calling sequence}}

The calling sequence resembles a command line for calling the
embedded application.  It can contain templates that will be
replaced with specific parameters by the gopher server before
executing the command line.  These are currently defined templates:

\noindent\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
template        & replacement                             \\ \hline\hline
{\tt @kw}       & key term as delivered in the selector         \\ \hline
{\tt @fn}       & filename for the output file                  \\ \hline
{\tt @ft}       & filetype for the output file                  \\ \hline
{\tt @fm}       & filemode for the output file                  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}




\subsubsection{{\tt GOPHERD.INDEX}}\label{rootindex}
 
  This file is the main index (root index), it is sent out whenever
  an empty selector string comes in.
 
 


\subsubsection{Format of an Index File}

  The server does not distinguish between index files and any other
  text file, therefore, index files are implicitly just text files that
  have the directory structure as defined in \cite{gophprot}.
  Thus, all records in an index file have the form...\\
\rule{0mm}{1mm}

  \fbox{\sl type display {\tt TAB} selector {\tt TAB} host {\tt TAB} port}

\subsection{Global Variables}
 
  Global variables are used to define a couple of parameters for the
  server, they are set and accessed using GLOBALV and are found in the
  group GOPHER in {\tt LASTING.GLOBALV}.  Table \ref{srvglv} on page
  \pageref{srvglv} lists all relevant global variables for the
  multi-threaded server daemon.



\subsection{Hooks in the Server Code}

The GOPHERDD server code provides a number of hooks.  A server
administrator can install programs that are called by the server
under certain conditions.

\subsubsection{GSH\_REAC EXEC}
Executed after an REACCESS event, triggered either by a
SYS-REACCESS request from the gopher server or by a SYS-REACCESS
message.

\subsubsection{GSH\_WAIT EXEC}
Execute some commands after n seconds of idle waiting.

The Index Editor provides an interactive tool for modifying index files.
The program is, as usual, set up as a XEDIT macro, the function keys are
defined in table \ref{EDINDEX} on page \pageref{EDINDEX}.
It consists of the following modules:
\begin{itemize} 
\item  {\tt EDINDEX.EXEC}:  the editor for INDEX files\\
\item  {\tt EDINDEX.XEDIT}: screen mask for INDEX files
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Server Scanner}

The file {\tt GOPHSCAN.EXEC} is a program that can scan a specified server
for all it's menus.  It can be used for testing the server, or to get a
master index for that server.  The program can also scan several servers
in one session, for instance all servers on campus to get a master index
for the complete campus.

{\tt GOPHSCAN} will only scan those servers, that are specified on
invocation, so it will {\bf not} wade through all gopher space the minute
it is started.  However, even small servers turn out to have a lot of data,
so it might be possible, that one run leads to an enormous amount of data.

The program was invented for providing a seperate program with data for an
experimental `on-campus Veronica'.  The other program is not finished yet
and will be released as a seperate package, eventually.




\section{Spin-Off Programs}

% * Remote User Information Protocol: (FINGER)
%   * FINGERXX.EXEC
%   * FINGER.EXEC
% * COOKIE


\subsection{Remote User Information Protocol: (FINGER)}

%   * FINGERXX.EXEC
%   * FINGER.EXEC



\subsubsection{{\tt FINGERXX.EXEC}}
 
  This program prepares the data for a user information query and writes
  it either to a file or the console.  The program is normally either
  called by {\tt GOPHERDD.EXEC} to process a FINGER query or 
  a {\tt SPEC-FINGER} request
  from the Gopher server.  {\tt FINGERXX.EXEC} is usually not
  invoked by the user directly.  The implementation
  of the output preparation module tried to fulfill all
  requirements of RFC1288 \cite{rfc1288}
  and it can now be said that it is compliant to this standard.
 
\noindent User information has several options and consists of several parts:

\begin{enumerate} 
\item empty query string (\{C\} query)\\
     The program returns the list of all logged in virtual machines.
     RFC1288 specifies that a finger server ``MUST at least provide the
     full name'' of all online users.  The full name of the owner of a
     virtual machine is looked up in the file
     {\tt LOCAL.NAMES} using NAMEFIND.
 
\item in-depth status of a specified user (\{U\}\{C\} query)\\
     The program tries to return following information components:

\begin{enumerate}
\item user log-on status:\\
        RFC1288 requires: ``An answer MUST include at least the full name
        of the user.''  The program returns the userid, full name,
        terminal number and the phone number (local extension), provided
        that this information can be found in the lookup files.
 
\item a user information file: {\tt FINGERID.}{\sl{userid}}\\
        The contents of this file is returned
        without filtering, it will reside on one of the Gopher service
        machine's public disks so that the GOPHERDD daemon as well as any
        user invoking FINGER has read access to the file.
 
\item information from a phone book file: {\tt PHONEBK.NAMES}
\end{enumerate}

\item phone book lookup: a string containing blanks\\
     This query type is interpreted as a full name (which is invalid as
     a userid under VM/CMS) that has to be looked up in the phone book.
     Any phone book entry matching the query string will be returned.
 
\item phone number query: {\tt \#}{\sl{number}}\\
     This query type is interpreted as a phone number that has to be
     looked up in the phone book.  Any phone book entry matching the
     query string will be returned.
\end{enumerate}

  Full names are contained in the file {\tt LOCAL.NAMES}, it is looked up
  using NAMEFIND.\\
\rule{0mm}{2mm}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{The following fields are required to be present}\\ \hline
  {\tt :nick. }    &   the userid of the virtual machine\\
  {\tt :name. }    &   the name of the virtual machine's owner\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\rule{0mm}{5mm}

  The phone book is a file named {\tt PHONEBK.NAMES} which is processed using
  NAMEFIND.\\
\rule{0mm}{2mm}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{The following fields are required to be present}\\ \hline
  {\tt :nick. }     & any unambigous string\\
  {\tt :name. }     & the user's full name\\
  {\tt :cnt.  }     & contents: list of all other field tags\\
\hline\hline
\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{The following fields are present at my installation}\\
\hline
  {\tt :phone. }    & the user's phone number\\
  {\tt :fname. }    & the user's first name\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\rule{0mm}{5mm}

\noindent Notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item  A {\tt /W} token as defined in RFC1288 is
     ignored and a message indicating
     the absence of verbose information is appended to the output.
\item  Finger forwarding is actively refused by returning the message:
     ``Finger forwarding service is denied'' as defined in RFC1288.
\end{itemize}
 


\subsubsection{{\tt FINGER.EXEC}}
 
  This program is a spin-off product of the FINGER protocol
  implementation in GOPHERDD and interfaces {\tt FINGERXX.EXEC} for local and
  remote user information queries.  The program can contact finger
  servers on remote hosts and display the resulting information on the
  console.
 
 


\subsection{Quote-of-the-Day Protocol: (COOKIE or FORTUNE)}
 
  The program {\tt COOKIE.EXEC} is called by {\tt GOPHERDD.EXEC}
  to produce a short text file used as a fortune cookie served by the
  Quote-of-the-Day protocol \cite{rfc865} server.
  The program can also be invoked by the user directly and displays the
  message at the user's console.
 
  Two files are used, {\tt FORTUNE.TXT} which holds the fortune texts and
  {\tt FORTUNE.IDX} which lists the beginning and end record numbers of
  all messages in the cookie database.  Any user invoking COOKIE needs
  read access to these files, consequently, these files will be held
  on the Gopher service machine's public disk.
 
\noindent A couple of modifications seem to be appropriate:
\begin{itemize}
\item different cookie bases with different type of contents might be a
     nice idea.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Notes:
\begin{itemize}
\item  The server is RFC865 compliant but listens only on TCP port 17
     and not on a corresponding UDP port.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{{\tt REXTCPIP.MODULE}: {\tt TCPopen()} timing}

    For some reason, the VM client could not talk to the VM server, if
    both were on the same machine.  This was a problem intrinsic to the
    original version of REXTCPIP, it is discussed here and a fix is
    presented in figure \ref{fix4} later on.

    What happened exactly, when the orginal versions were used:
\begin{itemize}
\item When the client opens a TCP connection to the server, the server
      changes its status from {\sl listening} at the port to 
      {\sl receiving},
      the connection status is then `{\tt Connected}' (Just as wanted).
\item However, the client's TCPOPEN call doesn't return so the
      client program hangs and the server's connection status is
      never changing.
      The single-threaded server could not handle other requests
      during that time, for the multi-threaded server, however,
      this wasn't really a problem, just a bit more of overhead.
\item If the client is finally killed and the TCB (TCP control block)
      gets removed
      by the system (this can be triggerd by calling NETSTAT on the
      client's VM) the TCP connection on the server side breaks down
      and the single-threaded server returns to the listen status and
      behaves normally again, the multi-threaded server simply eliminates
      that particular connection.
\end{itemize}
    One solution for
    this problem was to allow the local client to access the
    servers mini disk(s) directly.  Consequently, local connections
    with direct access to the server's files
    did not use TCPIP at all.  I was a bit lazy implementing all
    system and special functions of the GOPHERDD-server in the client
    so some of these will not work.

This kind of behaviour was finally identfied as a waiting problem 
intrinsic to
    {\tt REXTCPIP.MODULE}.  The function {\tt TCPopen()} waits for a
    {\em change} of the TCPIP machines control flag for the TCP connection.
    The flag indicates the presence of an established connection.
    The code assumes that a connection is not established without any
    noticable delay, but, in fact, the connection is established almost
    immediately and the control flag does not change anymore.  Due to that,
    this wait call will result in a loop waiting endlessly.
    Figure \ref{fix4} describes a fix for this problem where the wait
    macro is skipped for local connections.  As of now this worked fine.

\subsection{{\tt REXTCPIP.MODULE}: {\tt TCPclose()} hanging}

% (Server hangs when connection is not closed propperly by other side)
% (fix see figure \ref{fix2})

{\tt REXTCPIP} used to wait for the other side to {\em propperly} close the
connection before the program closed the connection and control data
structures itself.  In some case this caused the server to hang because
the client wasn't either able to close the connection or didn't implment
the protocol carefully enough.  A fix in {\tt REXTCPIP.ASSEMBLE} as shown
in figure \ref{fix2} allows the server to close the connection without
waiting for the client.

\subsection{{\tt REXTCPIP.MODULE}: {\tt GetIPAddr()} name resolution}
\label{bug.fdns}
 
The function {\tt GetIPAddr()} in {\tt REXTCPIP.MODULE}
ands over most of the work to the nameserver and returns whatever
he first nameserver comes up with.

The NAMESRV virtual machine might not deliver the correct IP-address as
expected, sometimes the lookup would simply fail and no IP-address
would be returned at all.
Apparently, the function {\tt GetIPAddr()} together with NAMESRV are
quite `case sensitive' so that the function returns different
IP-addresses for various upper/lower case combinations of a
given host name.

\noindent  Examples:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item (done second week of March 1992)\\
\begin{tabular}{|lcl|}\hline
  {\tt   ganymed.wu-wien.ac.at } & $\Longrightarrow$ & failed \\
  {\tt   GANYMED.WU-Wien.AC.AT } & $\Longrightarrow$ & 137.208.5.2 \\
  {\tt   GANYMED.WU-WIEN.AC.AT } & $\Longrightarrow$ & failed \\
  {\tt   Ganymed.WU-Wien.AC.AT } & $\Longrightarrow$ & failed \\

  {\tt   uicvm.UIC.EDU         } & $\Longrightarrow$ & 128.248.???.??? \\
\hline\end{tabular}

\item (done third week of March 1992)\\
\begin{tabular}{|lcl|}\hline
  {\tt   ganymed.wu-wien.ac.at } & $\Longrightarrow$ & 137.208.5.2 \\

  {\tt   UICVM.UIC.EDU         } & $\Longrightarrow$ & 128.248.2.50 \\
\hline\end{tabular}
\end{itemize}
 
  As you can see from these examples, this situation was unsatisfying and
  so FDNS was created to provide a quick hack to
  circumvent {\tt GetIPAddr()}.
 
  After several days of discussion\footnote{with Ken Hornstein and
  Alan Flavel} and testing the following solution
  was found:  removing the entry {\tt NSINTERADDR 14.0.0.0} from the file
  {\tt TCPIP.DATA} and providing an entry pointing to a UNIX nameserver,
  as shown in figure \ref{fix3}, works reliably.
 
  Please note also that this problem can't be solved by simply
  translating the host name either to lower case or to upper case!
 
  Maybe it's possible to find even better solutions for this problem,
  if you do, please drop me a line.  In my oppinion, improving
  {\tt GetIPAddr()} is the most promising path to take.

\begin{itemize}
\item Please report any bugs you find and feel free to make
    suggestions for improvements etc...

\item Send me email if you've installed either the server or the client
    and tell me if you wish to receive updates.

\subsection{Notes}
 
\begin{itemize}
\item The center of Gopher Space is {\tt gopher.micro.umn.edu}, the
      FTP archive is {\tt boombox.micro.umn.edu}.

\item There exists a different implementation for VM, sometimes refered to
      as the `Rice' VM Gopher System.  RXSOCKET and PIPES are requiered
      for this one.  For information about this system contact Rick Troth,
      his email address is {\tt TROTH@RICEVM1.bitnet}.
 
%%\item Apparently, another VM/CMS Gopher Server/Client was implemented.
%%      This one uses RXSOCKET and PIPES too.  No further details are
%%      known about it.
 
\item A Gopher server running under MVS also exists.  (mvs.udel.edu)
      The author is Steve Bacher, his email address is
      {\tt seb1525@mvs.draper.com}.
 
\item The news group {\tt comp.infosystems.gopher}
      (in former times {\tt alt.gopher})
      exists for discussion of Gopher in general,
      the Bitnet Listserv mailing list {\tt VMGOPHER@PUCC.bitnet}
      was created for discussion of Gophers running on VM.

\item Gopher has a couple of close or not so close relatives:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf CWIS}: Campuswide Information Systems\\
      ... some of them are Gophers in disguise, others would like to be.
\item {\bf Gopher+}:\\
      Other Gophers think he's a snob, but he is not $\ldots$\\
      ... he's just a bit more sophisticated than the ordinary
      ones!\footnote{details can be found in \cite{gophplus}.}
\item {\bf PANDA}:\\
      ... a special breeding of Gophers that is now domestified in Iowa.
      The home of panda is {\tt panda.uiowa.edu}.  Some Gophers are
      in fact cross-breedings of the archaic Gopher generation and
      Pandas (e.g. VieGOPHER).
\item {\bf WAIS}: Wide Area Information Server\\
      ... a quite powerful information retrieval package that is often
      used as the search engine of choice in Gopher Space.
      WAIS-world has it's center in
      {\tt quake.think.com} \footnote{a lot of useful information about WAIS,
      e.g. \cite{WAIS1} can be found there}.
      A very good introduction can be found in \cite{WAIS.intro}.
\item {\bf WWW}: World-Wide Web\\
      Internet-wide distributed hypertext system based on the
      HTTP protocol.  (Hypertext transport protocol)
%%%\item {\bf RCP}: Remote Cluster Protocol\\
%%%      The networked extension of Tylman Susato's NED based
%%%      open hypertext system.

\subsection{Discussion: Why are things the way they are?}



\subsubsection{Client: writing files to disk temporarily}

I was asked more than once why the client writes files received from
the server to disk first, reads it into editor memory and then discards
the disk file.  Alan Flavel suggested that {\tt GOPHFTCH.EXEC}
should push lines to the stack, wrapped into {\sf XEDIT} red tape.
At this point, finally, this shortcoming is more or less
resolved.\footnote{If you want more backgroud information about the
way VieGOPHER operates in certain situations, please drop me a line...}

\noindent
There were several reasons why the file write method was used:\\
{\bf First:}  the client started as a single module that had to
fetch items and store them to disk.  This was initially the only
purpose of {\tt GOPHFTCH.EXEC}.  Later, as interactive XEDIT
support was added, the implementation of {\tt GOPHFTCH.EXEC}
remained more or less intact.\\
{\bf Second:}  there are in fact items in Gopher Space that have
record sizes of more than 256 bytes, e.g. directories from
WAIS-to-Gopher gateways sometimes deliver records in the range
of 600 bytes per line.  A record on the stack can only be
255 byte long, so using the stack for holding incoming data
items requires a method for breaking up long lines.  This fact
should explain the format of data on the stack described in
figure \ref{stack.format} on page \pageref{stack.format}.

\rule{0mm}{5mm}

The current implementation of VieGOPHER features another method
of bringing data to the screen.  In a typical gopher session, the
fetcher module {\tt GOPHFTCH.EXEC} is called with the {\tt XEDIT} file mode
option.  This option allows the fetcher to transfer data directly to
XEDIT data buffer and commands XEDIT to refresh the screen after the
first couple of lines in order to bring the data to screen as fast as
possible.  For long files this has the effect that a user can
read the first screen while the rest of the file is still being transfered.

Unfortunately, this version still does not feature an interrupt method
or a transparent interaction method, so the user is required to wait
until the data transfer is finally over.  During the transfer, XEDIT
displays the number of lines transfered sofar in the message area.

For transfering index files that originate from a type 7 search,
the write - read - erase method is used as described before.  The
reason for doing so originates from the fact that WAIS searches ---
these generate type 7 indexes --- can produce enourmously long
selector strings (paths).  This compromise allows to circumvent problems
with extremely long lines which otherwise makes it impossibly to
successfully process incoming data.

%{\bf Conclusion:}  Even when I know that  passing data via disk
%is not so  optimal I'll have to leave things as they are right
%now, because eliminating this behaviour would cost a considerable
%amount of energy which I think should be better spent at more
%problematic spots in or around VieGOPHER for now.
%Appendix \ref{to-do} at page \pageref{to-do} lists more things than
%I would like to find there.

%{\bf P.S.:}  If someone is able and willing to provide code
%for a better approach, it will be appreciated.




\subsection{{\tt GOPHERDD.EXEC}}
 
The multi-threaded server handles several connections by using a number
of so-called slots and a number of variables where information for each
slot is recorded.  All slots are checked and serviced periodically.  The
server starts by posting a LISTEN call for one or more different ports
and assinging the status for LISTEN to these slots.  When a connection
on a port is established the server immediately assigns a new slot for
that server type and post's the next listen call on the same port.
Periodically, the program checks which slot it has to serve and
eventually if a service is finished and the slot's status is changed
to UNASSIGNED.  If a connection crashes or behaves in some strange way
the slot status is changed to dead and is not serviced any longer.
A recovery strategy for the case of severe problems is currently in
design.
