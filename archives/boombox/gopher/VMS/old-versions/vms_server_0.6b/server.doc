I. Overview of the Internet Gopher Server.

The Internet Gopher is a distributed document delivery service.  It
allows a neophyte user to access various types of data residing on
multiple hosts in a seamless fashion.  This is accomplished by
presenting the user a hierarchical arrangement of documents and by
using a client-server communications model.  The Internet Gopher
Server accepts simple queries, and responds by sending the client a
document. 

The document types that are currently supported are:

	1. Generic Text Files.
	2. Directories/Links.
	3. CSO Phone Book Services.
	4. Full Text Indexes.

The document types are experimental and subject to change.

	1. Digitized sounds.

Currently the Internet Gopher Server software supports Text Files,
Directories and Sounds.  A CSO implementation is available from the
University of Illinois.  A full text index server is available for
NeXTs.  It is described in a seperate document.



III. Setting Up Your Server.
----------------------------

Setting up a gopher server is similar to setting up an anonymous ftp
site.   The first step is to compile the server.  When that's done
make a directory to hold the data.  If you want, you can even use your
present anonymous ftp directory.  (The server masks out the usr/,
bin/, dev/, and etc/ directories.  It also doesn't show core files
either :-O).  One note of warning, the gopher server will become
confused if you run it on a directory that's a symbolic link.  Once
your data directory is set up you can start the gopher server.

You must do this as root, since gopher does a chroot to the gopher
directory (like anonymous ftp).  Thus the only information that is
transmitted to the outside world is what's in the gopher-data
directory. We wouldn't want little gophers tunneling to a cracker with
your password file now would we!

For instance say that your gopher data resides in a directory called
/home/gopher-data.  To start the gopher daemon you would type
in the following:

   mkdir /home/mudhoney/gopher-data
   /usr/local/etc/gopherd /home/gopher-data 150

The gopher daemon forks off and will then start accepting connections.
You can easily test the server by using telnet to connect to the port
specified on the command line.  Once connected, type return.  A list
of things in the gopher-data directory should be returned.  For
instance let's say that the server was started on the machine
mudhoney.  To test it you'd do the following: 

mudhoney[6:18pm]-=> telnet gopher 70
Trying 128.101.95.29 ...
Connected to gopher.micro.umn.edu.
Escape character is '^]'.

    mudhoney[6:21pm]-=> 


Unless you want greasy grimy gopher guts on your computer you'll also
put something similar to the following in you rc.local or equivilant: 

if [ -f /usr/local/etc/gopherd ]; then
	/usr/local/etc/gopherd /home/mudhoney/gopher-data 150
fi


IV. Usage
---------

gopherd [-l <logfile>] [-s <securityfile>] <datadir> <port>

The -l parameter is used to specify a logfile.  Right now, the
server just logs the time and the host of each connection.  If there
isn't a -l option passed to gopherd then no logging is done.

The -s parameter is used to control access to the server.  When a host
connects to the server, the server checks for matches in the security
file.  The criteria for matching is:

     if the entry is numeric (i.e. an internet #) then we get a match if
     the "hostname" matches the numeric string or the numeric string +
     anything else, i.e. an entry like "128.101" would match 128.101.95.1
     but not 37.15.128.101.
     
     if the entry is alphebetic then we test in the other direction.
     i.e. umn.edu would match moocow.umn.edu but now umn.edu.com
     
     if the entry is preceded by an exclamation mark then matches
     are done as above, however access is when a match is made in
     this case.
     
     Matches are checked in the order they are in the security file.
     If you want it to work correctly go from the specific to the
     general.


V. Adding Data to the Gopher Server.
-------------------------------------

To make a gopher directory, just use "mkdir" to create a directory in
the gopher data directory.  For instance, say you had a bunch of Heavy
Metal Lyrics you wanted to put online, you would do the following: 

cd /home/mudhoney/gopher-data
mkdir "Heavy Metal Lyrics"
cd "Heavy Metal Lyrics"
mkdir Metallica

Okay, now you want to add some text files to your gopher database.  To
do this just create and/or copy your textfiles into the directories in
the gopher Server data directory.  Here's a quick example:

cd "/home/mudhoney/gopher-data/Heavy Metal Lyrics/Metallica"
cp ~/mop.txt "Master of Puppets"

You'll want to create your text files and directories with descriptive
names.  Poor folks with 14 character System V filesystems should just
try the best they can......

Now here comes the tricky part, Links.  The ability to make links to
other hosts is how gopher distributes itself among multiple hosts.
There are two different ways to make a link.  The first and simplest
is to create a link file that contains the data needed by the server.
By default all files in the gopher data directory starting with a
period are taken to be link files.  A link file can contain multiple
links.  A define a link you need to put five lines in a link file that
define the needed characteristics for the document.  Here is an
example of a link.

Name=Cheese Ball Recipes
Type=1
Port=150
Path=1/Moo/Cheesy
Host=zippy.micro.umn.edu

The Name= line is what the user will see when cruising through the
database.  In this case the name is "Cheese Ball Recipes".  The
"Type=" defines what kind of document this object is.  The following
is a list of all the defined types:

0  -- Text File
1  -- Directory
2  -- CSO name server.
7  -- Full Text Index
8  -- Telnet Session
s  -- Sound

The "Path=" line contains the selector string that the client will use
to retrieve the actual document.  The port and host lines should
speak for themselves.

An easy way to retrieve this information is to use telnet to get the
information.  For instance let's say you want to link the University
of Minnesota's Gopher Server to your gopher server.  Just telnet to
the port (like in the example above) and retrieve the information.
The server returns a list in the following format:

<character Object Type><TAB><Name><TAB><Path><TAB><Host><TAB><Port>

You need to keep the Object Type, Path, Host, and Port the same in the
link.  You can change the name of the document if you want.


The second method of creating a link is a bit harder, however it's
ideal for such things as sounds where the only change needed is the
object type.

Here's how you'd change the file /home/mudhoney/sounds/Moo into a
sound: 

  cd /home/mudhoney/gopher-data/sounds/
  mkdir .cap
  cd .cap
  cat >Moo
  Type=s
  ^D

The idea is that you create a directory called .cap in the same
directory as the document.  Then you create a file with the same name
in the hidden .cap directory with the lines that you want changed.
You only need to put in what needs to be changed.  The server will
supply defaults if it doesn't find out what it needs.  In the above
example for instance, the host would supply the Name, Host, Port and
Path for the object.  The only thing that changed was the type.
