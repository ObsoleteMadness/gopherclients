1) check the input line for a file or directory listing to be sure that it
begins with gopher_root to prevent looking around the system and pulling other
files that you don't want anyone to have, like the sysuaf.dat file.  This will
lock the process into files that are in the gopher_root tree.

2) use logical names for the specification of the log file and security file.
**** fixed 1/28/92 ****

3) create a start_gopher.com procedure to start the gopher server until the
server will start from the network process.  This can also be used as an option
to start the server rather than having the network process start the server.
**** created 1/28/92 - need more work here yet ****

4) fix the server so that it can be started from inetd or some such thing.


5) add support for compressed files.
