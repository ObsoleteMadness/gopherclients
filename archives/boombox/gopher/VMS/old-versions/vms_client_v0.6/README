VMS gopher client and server sites,

At present, there is no VMS version of the gopher client or server that
will function with UCX.  I do not have direct access to any UCX
documentation.  To make the client and/or server run the UCX, all the
Unix-like calls need to be modified and conditionals placed in the code
for it to work with UCX.  UCX does not provide, at least that I can
tell, simple interfaces to things like bind(), listen(),
socket_read(){Multinet}, netread(){WIN/TCP}, and the like.  When time
permits me to do so, I will modify the code to use UCX on a conditional
basis.  All UCX calls are done with $QIO and not the simple interface.
My best access to UCX documentation is via bookreader over a 56K line to
a machine 160 miles away where I can only hope that the documentation is
online when I need it.  These modifications are on the TODO list.
