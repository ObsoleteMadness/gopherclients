***** PC Gopher III has been obsoleted by MINUET. ******


This is the latest release of PC Gopher III.  Be sure to grab the
release notes file along with everything else; it contains the list of
known bugs, and any last-minute changes.

PCG3BIN.ZIP contains the executables, the documentation is in
PCG3DOC.ZIP.  There are also self extracting versions of these archives:
PCG3BINX.EXE and PCG3DOCX.EXE.

We're now using PKZIP version 2.04g to make .ZIP files, so if you don't
have access to a copy of this version of PKZIP, get the self-extracting
archives.

Bug reports to gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu.
