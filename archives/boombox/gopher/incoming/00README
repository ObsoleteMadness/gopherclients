This is a place where you can upload patches, etc. for gopher.

Since we got tired of cleaning out non-gopher related materials,
please let us know if you want to upload something and we will
turn on writing to this directory. Unsupervised uploads were getting
a bit out of hand.

So, if you want put anything here, please send mail to 
     gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu
and let us know what it is and we can make arrangements....
