Assembling and utilizing the creative and technical energy to 
conceive of and develop the Internet Gopher must have been an 
exciting and challenging task for the University of 
Minnesota's Internet Gopher Development Team.  But with the 
popularity of Gopher throughout the world, the team members 
can certainly be proud of their efforts.

Gopher is information discovery/retrieval software currently 
in use at the University of Georgia.  You can use a Gopher 
client (software that runs on CMS and CONTAC, DOS, Macintosh, 
Unix, etc.) to connect to the UGA Gopher server and find out 
what's for lunch at Bolton or Snelling, check out campus 
events, connect to the UGA Libraries Online Catalog, search 
and browse the UGA Policies and Procedures Manual, and check 
out the Athens weather.  And this is only the beginning.  
Employing the computers and networks on the worldwide 
Internet, you can navigate through UGA's slice of Gopherspace 
to Gopher servers through the world. 

The client/server protocol
Based on the client/server model, the Gopher client presents 
you with a menued hierarchy of information items.  The menu 
and associated items are delivered to the client from a 
Gopher server, a repository for the information you receive. 
You can then select items from a menu to retrieve a specific 
piece of information or a directory of related items.

How you select, retrieve, and search the items presented to 
you by the server will depend on the client you are using.  
This is truly the essence of a client/server protocol--a set 
of rules which allows different computers and operating 
systems to communicate with one another. A DOS client, 
Macintosh client, Unix client, or CMS client all receive the 
same information.  The client, however, displays the 
information items in a fashion suitable to the environment in 
which the client resides.  As an example, let's look at how a 
graphical user interface on a Macintosh compares to a textual 
user interface on CMS and CONTAC 
(Figure 1).

Navigating
There are several obvious differences in the two menu views 
presented.  Notice how the menu items, which are all submenus 
(or directories), are represented as folder icons on the 
Macintosh.  The word "menu" represents the same item type on 
the CMS client.  With the Macintosh client, the mouse is your 
primary tool for navigating through Gopherspace.  The 
keyboard performs the equivalent function when using the CMS 
client.  The Macintosh user would select the "Weather" item 
by using the mouse to position the cursor on "Weather" and 
clicking the mouse button twice.  The CMS user would use the 
tab key to position the cursor on "Weather" and press ENTER.  
Each selection activity is endemic to the client's 
environment and would yield the same list of related items.


Clients and servers
If ubiquity is a virtue, then Gopher is a candidate for 
sainthood.  Listed below are the more popular clients and 
server.  The majority of Gopher software is available at the 
University of Minnesota's anonymous FTP site:

     boombox.micro.umn.edu

in the directory:

     /pub/gopher

In order to cut down on unnecessary network traffic, UCNS has 
placed (and endeavors to keep in place) the most recent 
versions of the more popular clients and servers on the 
University of Georgia's anonymous FTP site:

     ftp.uga.edu

The specific directory location for each file is included in 
the description.  Also note references to "Gopher+" in the 
descriptions.  Gopher+ is the next generation of Gopher 
clients and servers (more on Gopher+ in the section 
"Multimedia and Beyond with Gopher+space").  

General requirements
Only computers connected to the campus network (and therefore 
the worldwide Internet) can use Gopher.  For those who are 
not so fortunate as to have desktop connectivity to the 
campus network,  UCNS provides a Gopher client on CMS and 
CONTAC.  If you have an account on CMS or CONTAC, you can use 
Gopher from there (regardless of how you connect).  UGA 
departments with Unix systems may also have a Gopher client 
installed.  Contact your departmental Unix administrator for 
more information.

Network-related configuration
When configuring Gopher, there are a few bits of information 
you will need to know.  These include:

Gopher Server:
     gopher.uga.edu
     (This is the UGA Gopher server.)

Gopher Port:
     70
     (This is the port number for the UGA Gopher server.  All
     Gopher servers use port numbers for connections; 70 is 
     the standard port number.)

Your Computer's IP Address:
     (You will have to know this.  If you don't know, contact 
     your department's network domain liaison.)

Network Mask:
     255.255.0.0
     (The network mask relates to how the local area network 
     your computer is connected to is configured with respect 
     to the campus network.)

Name Servers:
     128.192.1.9
     129.192.8.4
     (The first number is the primary campus name server.  In 
     the event that the primary name server is inaccessible, 
     the secondary name server is used.  Name servers allow 
     you to use descriptive names (e.g., gopher.uga.edu) 
     instead of numeric addresses to connect to other 
     computers on the Internet.)

Gateway:
     128.192.1.1
     (The gateway is a device which gives you access to the 
     rest of the world.)

IBM PC (and compatible)

     delivery of a few special items.  

     Documentation included with distribution.

CMS and CONTAC
     Client installed by UCNS.

MVS (TSO)
     Client currently being tested by UCNS.  

Menus and files
When describing collections of items in Gopherspace the term 
"menu" is synonymous with "directory."  Within menus or 
directories are related items.  The most basic unit within a 
directory is typically a file.  

Figure 2 provides a view from the PC Gopher III (DOS) client 
of the items available after selecting "Library" from the UGA 
Gopher server top-level menu and then "UGA Library - GALIN."  
The PC Gopher III client allows you to use either the mouse 
or keyboard to select the item you want.  The second screen 
in Figure 2 shows how the document "About GALIN" would be 
presented.

                    File Display View


Common to all Gopher clients are the two screens shown in 
Figure 2.  A Browser View allows you to select an item in a 
menu and the File Display View presents the item selected.  
In a graphical environment, these will appear as  windows 
which may cascade on the screen.  When multiple windows are 
displayed on the screen, you can use the mouse (TurboGopher) 
to make any window the active window.  PC Gopher III allows 
you to use either the mouse or the keyboard to activate a 
window.  In a non-graphical environment, there is usually a 
"Go Back" or "Return" key to navigate back through selected 
menus.  

Search Items for documents and document groups
One of the more powerful items available in Gopherspace is a 
search item, usually indicated by the word "search" or a 
question mark.  Most search items in Gopherspace are provided 
in conjunction with WAIS (Wide Area Information Servers), 
public domain software generously offered to the Internet 
community by Thinking Machines Corporation.  WAIS is used to 
create full-text indexes of documents and document groups; 
Gopher provides easy access to these indexes. 

When you select a search item, you will be prompted for words 
that will be used to search a group of related documents.  
Typically, you will type in the word or words that relate to 
something you want to know more about, press ENTER, and wait 
patiently for a list of related documents to be returned.

Here's how searching works.  If you supply a single word as a 
search request, a list of documents that contain that single 
word will be returned.  You are not, however, limited to 
searching on a single word.  Multiple search words can be 
used.  For all WAIS-based searches, multiple words (each 
separated by a space) will return a list of documents that 
contain either word.  You will often see this relationship 
between the multiple words referred to as an "implied OR" 
relationship.  For example, if you navigated through the UGA 
Gopher server to the search item for issues of the UCNS 
Computer Review:

  UGA Departments -> Computing & Networking -> Newsletters ->
  UCNS Computer Review -> Search the UCNS Computer Review

and then entered the search request:

   macintosh ibm

the list of documents returned (about 60) would contain 
either the word "macintosh" OR the word "ibm" OR both words.  
Supplying search words this way expands your search.  
You can, however, limit your search by connecting the two 
words with the connecting term AND.  If you entered the 
search request:

   macintosh and ibm

the list of documents returned (about 15) would contain both 
the word "macintosh" AND the word "ibm."  Supplying search 
words this way limits your search.  You can further limit 
your search with the connecting term NOT, as shown in Figure 
3.

The search request shown in Figure 3 would return a list of 
documents (about 2) that contain both the word "macintosh" 
AND the word "ibm" but NOT the word "software."

One important caveat.  Not all WAIS-based searches in 
Gopherspace allow you to use the connecting terms AND and NOT 
to limit your search.  While the UGA Gopher server does allow 
the use of these connecting terms, you may encounter some 
searches that only allow the implied OR search.  If you try 
to use the connecting terms AND or NOT on a search item that 
does not allow their use, AND or NOT are ignored and an 
implied OR is used.

After performing a search, notice the order of the returned 
documents.  The documents near the top of the list will very 
likely be the better match to your search request.  The 
ordering is a product of "relevance feedback," which scores 
the returned documents based on word frequency , word 
position, and size of document.

Internet Duct Tape
Members of the Gopher Development Team have referred to 
Gopher as "Internet Duct Tape"; others have described Gopher 
as "a high-level networking tool."   Two ways of saying 
essentially the same thing, albeit the latter being a more 
sophisticated phrase.  From within Gopher's comfortable 
environment you can use Telnet to connect to online library 
catalogs all over the word; acquire documents and software 
from archive sites; and search electronic phone books and 
directories  for individuals at universities, colleges, and 
other organizations worldwide. 

Telnet sessions
Telnet is a service which allows you to connect to computers 
on the Internet using terminal emulation.  Typically, you are 
required to log into these systems as a validated user.  
However, many colleges and universities allow you to access 
library holdings via Telnet.  The UGA Libraries' online 
catalog (GALIN) is available from the UGA Gopher server in 
the menu item "Library."  Also notice that Telnet connections 
to libraries through the world are also included in the 
"Library" menu item.  

Notes about Telnet sessions:
*  Gopher Telnet items are indicated either by a word or an 
appropriate icon.   The word or icon may indicate a tn3270 
connection.  A tn3270 connection is often required for 
connecting to IBM mainframes.  

*  Gopher uses the Telnet client on the computer you are 
using to make the connection.  When configuring some Gopher 
clients you may have to specify the Telnet/tn3270 
applications to be used.  (PC Gopher III is an example.)

*  CMS and CONTAC users should be aware that the Telnet 
client available to them does not support terminal emulation 
other than tn3270.  If you attempt a Telnet connection to a 
site requiring VT100 emulation (the most common), you may not 
be able to function as well as you would like.

*  TurboGopher (Macintosh client) requires System 7 or higher 
for a smooth transition to Telnet/tn3270.  You can still use 
Telnet sessions on a pre-System 7 Macintosh, but you will not 
be taken directly  to the Telnet session.

FTP gateway
The file transfer protocol (FTP) is an Internet service which 
allows someone using an FTP client to connect to an FTP 
server and transfer between the two systems.  Normal FTP 
requires that you have an account on the server system you 
are connecting to.  Anonymous FTP is a special setup on the 
FTP server which allows you to connect to the server without 
having an established account.  Gopher provides a gateway to 
anonymous FTP sites.

Access to selected anonymous FTP sites is available on the 
UGA Gopher server via the path:

  Worldwide Information -> Internet - RFCs, Archie, FTP and
  Veronica -> Connect to FTP Sites

At the end of this path is a list of anonymous sites.  When 
you select one of the sites, Gopher makes a connection to the 
FTP server and displays a list of files that you can transfer 
to yourself.  Figure 4 presents an example listing of the DOS 
archive site wuarchive.wustl.edu in the directory astronomy.

Notes about the FTP gateway:
*  Access to anonymous FTP sites via the UGA Gopher server is 
currently restricted to Gopher clients on the UGA campus.  

*  Files at anonymous FTP sites will often be software and 
other files that are ordinarily retrieved as binary.  Gopher 
recognizes these types and retrieves the file properly.  In 
general, files with the extensions .exe and .zip will be 
typed as "DOS" or "PC" and retrieved as binary.  Files with 
the extension .hqx are special Macintosh files that are 
retrieved as text.  Other files many be typed as generic 
"binary."  While Gopher takes care of retrieving the files 
properly,  you will have to keep the type of transfer (either 
text or binary) in mind if you move the file to another 
computer.

*  CMS and CONTAC Gopher users should pay special attention 
to the "Receive" key.  Use this key to retrieve a binary file 
displayed in a list.  There is no point in attempting to view 
such a file.  Many of the other popular clients --PC Gopher, 
TurboGopher, and Unix--automatically retrieve binary files 
when they are selected.


Electronic Phone Books and Directories
Finding people on the Internet is perhaps one of the more 
interesting and sometimes frustrating tasks with which you 
can be presented.  The University of Notre Dame Gopher 
provides a collection of online phone books and directories, 
which you can access from the UGA Gopher via the path:

  Worldwide Information -> Worldwide Phone Books and 
  Directories

You will notice one institution conspicuous by its absence in 
this collection -- The University of Georgia.  However, on a 
more positive note, plans are currently in place to provide a 
similar service for UGA.

Notes about electronic phone books and directories:

*  Be sure to read the related "About" documents in the list 
of items available in "Worldwide Phone Books and 
Directories."

*  Electronic phone books and directories are of several 
different types.  Some are based on CSO Nameserver (developed 
at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign).  This type 
of electronic phone book will be indicated by an icon of a 
phone book, the word "CSO" or the word "phonebk."  Other 
electronic phone books are based on WHOIS servers or WAIS-
based searches; these are indicated by  the word "search" or 
a question mark .


Multimedia and beyond with Gopher+space
As Gopher has developed over the past few years, so have the 
information types supported.  On some Gopher servers you will 
find sound files, images, and even movies.  With the advent 
of Gopher+, these new types are being effectively integrated 
into Gopherspace.

Appropriately enough, a picture is worth a thousand words 
when describing Gopher+space (Figure 5).

As an extension to Gopher, Gopher+ supports:
*  More compete information about a Gopher item.  Notice in 
Figure 5 that modification dates and sizes of particular 
items are now included.  Also included is the Gopher 
administrator's name and e-mail address.  (Item information 
can be retrieved from a Gopher or Gopher+ server the same 
way.  See the documentation or online help that came with 
your Gopher client for the procedure.)

   Abstracts can also be included as a part of the item 
information.

*  Alternate multiple views.  Everyone agrees that plain text 
isn't the most preferred way to deliver documents.  However, 
it does represent the "lowest common denominator" in that any 
Gopher client can adequately display text.  Gopher+ provides 
alternate views of such documents--including PostScript and 
Rich-Text Format (RTF) in addition to plain text.  The user 
of a Gopher+ client can request that these alternate views be 
listed and then request one of the alternate views from the 
list.

   Images can also be presented in this way.  Multiple views 
of a weather map could be available as a GIF, JPEG, or PPM 
image.  

*  Electronic forms.  Although relatively simple at this 
time, it is possible to set up a Gopher+ item as an 
electronic form.  When this item is selected, a blank 
electronic form is presented.  Information provided on the 
electronic form can then be mailed to the appropriate 
individual or office.


A Gopher+ server is currently in use at UGA for delivery of a 
few special items via the UGA Gopher primary server.  This 
server can be accessed directly if you would like to 
experiment with some of the Gopher+ features.  If you have a 
Gopher+ client, set your Gopher to connect to:

   gopher.uga.edu 9000

Gopher+ features can be found in the menu items "Multiple 
Views" and "Newsletter Registration Request Form."  Please be 
advised that this is a test Gopher environment.  Items are 
subject to move around or disappear without notice.  Access 
to the test server is currently restricted to the UGA campus.

More information on Gopher
If you would like to learn more about Gopher, there is a 
comprehensive guide titled Internet Gopher User's Guide.  
Several copies are available at the UCNS Help Desk in the 
Computer Services Annex.

Another excellent source of information is the USENET 
newsgroup: comp.infosystems.gopher.

Gopher-accessible information, including an FAQ (Frequently 
Asked Questions), is provided by the University of Minnesota.  
This information is available via the UGA Gopher in the 
"About Gopher at the University of Georgia" menu item.
