The Gopher Conference is being held in the Radisson Hotel MetroDome.
It really isn't that close to the stadium, it's two blocks from Gopher
Central and about 12 from the Stadium.

The Radisson doesn't offer courtesy shuttles for their guests.  You can
get a taxi for around $20 one way.  Another option is the Airport Express,
this is a van that costs $10 per person one way, or $15 round trip.

You can also take public transportation. The bus system is called the MTC
and it provides fairly frequent and complete service.  Board a #17
bus at the airport.  Pay the fare ($1 non-peak, $1.25 peak) and ask
for a transfer.  This bus will eventually take you to downtown 
Minneapolis.  However the #17 makes a stop near the West Bank of the
U of MN campus at Riverside and Cedar.  Exit here and walk two blocks north
on Cedar Ave. to the Washington Avenue Bus Shelter.  You'll want to be
on the south side of Washinton.  Pick up an eastbound #16 bus, it will
cross the bridge.  About 5 blocks later you'll be at the Radisson Hotel
(it's on your left).


Here's how to get to the Radisson by car:

The fastest/simplest way to get to the hotel is to go to 494 West
from the airport.  Follow 494 West for about 2-3 miles.  Then
take the 35W North exit.  Follow 35W through downtown Minneapolis.
Shortly thereafter you will see the signs for the University Avenue
Exit.  Take this exit and go right (East) on University Avenue.
Go about 10 Blocks to Oak Street and take a right (South).  You will
see the Williams Arena on your left at this point.  Go two blocks
south to Washington Avenue.  Take a right.  Go two blocks to the
Radisson.  It's on your left.
