                     GopherCON '95
______________________________________________________

This workshop/conference will be an excellent opportunity to 
learn about next-generation information system technologies 
such as GopherVR and the IICM's Hyper-G system in an informal 
workshop setting.

Highlights of GopherCON '95 will include new technology such 
as 3D user interfaces, applying spatial document clustering to 
searching document collections, and hypermedia technologies 
including the IICM's Hyper-G system (which supports Gopher, HTTP, 
and Hyper-G clients and hypermedia authoring tools for hypertext 
and video). 

GopherCON '95 will be a workshop-format meeting with limited 
attendance to promote discussion. Because attendance is limited, 
we suggest that you register as soon as possible.

                 Session Descriptions
______________________________________________________


[1]--------------
GopherVR and VRML
-----------------
Next-generation user interfaces for Internet navigation will incorporate 
3D scenes as both a graphical document type and as a way to visualize 
relationships in a collection of documents (GopherVR). The new GopherVR 
clients make it possible to view and navigate current Gopher servers' 
document and link collections as 3D scenes, and Gopher+ servers can 
easily give GopherVR clients hints about how to display the scene 
representing a Gopher directory. GopherVR opens up a new visual 
vocabulary for representing the relationships between items in Gopher, 
while preserving Gopher traditional strength in serving low-end clients 
with low bandwidth links.

This session is an overview of the design rationale and engineering 
tradeoffs in the current GopherVR clients, how GopherVR hierarchies and 
VRML documents address complimentary problems, and future directions for 
GopherVR and VRML development.


[2]---------------------------
The Hyper-G Information system 
------------------------------
Klaus Schmaranz <kschmar@iicm.tu-graz.ac.at>)

Currently, the most popular Internet information systems use 
distributed menus and searching (Gopher) or hypertext documents (WWW) to 
represent information spaces. The IICM at the Technical University in Graz, 
Austria has developed Hyper-G, a second generation information system which 
combines a structured hierarchy with hypermedia documents.Hyperlinks are 
supported in all document types including text, images, movies, 3D scenes 
and PostScript.

One of the most interesting features of Hyper-G is that links between 
documents and directories are two-way links, so it is possible to traverse 
the link in either direction. This makes it easy to view the collection of 
all documents that point to a given directory or document (a good way of 
finding related documents). Two-way links also make it possible to 
automatically update hypertext references when a document moves; this is
a problem that is not handled well by either Gopher or WWW currently.

This session covers the Hyper-G system architecture, how Hyper-G clients
work, and an overview of authoring hypermedia in Hyper-G to be served to 
Gopher, WWW, and Hyper-G clients, and will be presented by a member of the 
Hyper-GJdevelopment group from Graz.


[3]-----------------------------------------------
Update on the IICM, NCSA, and Gopher collaboration
--------------------------------------------------
The Hyper-G, NCSA Mosaic, and Gopher developers recently announced a joint 
development effort to produce VRweb 3D VRMLJclients for use with Gopher, 
Hyper-G and Mosaic clients. This session is an update on the progress of 
this effort.


[4]-----------------------------
Document Clustering for GopherVR
--------------------------------
One of the reasons for developing GopherVR is to make it possible to 
represent relationships between documents in a collection by spatially 
grouping the documents in a 3D scene. The is a particularly interesting 
technique when applied to searching and browsing a document collection. 
This session covers how we are clustering documents on GopherVR-aware 
servers, and how other search engines can use GopherVR clients to display 
clusters of documents.


[5]-------------------------------
Screen Scraping for Fun and Profit
----------------------------------
Screen scraping (harvesting information from 3270 terminal sessions) is one 
way to to provide an easy-to-use Gopher interface to information that is 
only available via a terminal-based interface. This session covers how a 
Unix gopher gateway was written to efficiently harvest information student 
grade information from 3270 terminal sessions, reformat the information, 
and present it via Gopher. If you have legacy systems that are not going to 
migrate to client/server technology anytime soon, you may want to apply 
these techniques to free your data without creating a shadow database system. 


[6]-----------------------------------
Gopher and OpenDoc component documents
--------------------------------------
The philosophy of the Gopher developers at the University of Minnesota has 
always been to develop small, modular applications, and OpenDoc's component 
architecture is a good match for this philosophy. This session will include 
an overview of OpenDoc and how we plan to integrate Gopher with OpenDoc 
documents.


[7]------------------------------------
Customizing Unix servers for 3D clients
---------------------------------------
This sessions covers how to customize an existing Unix server for GopherVR 
clients. You'll find out how easy it is to take an existing Unix Gopher 
server and have it return a +3D: attribute to specify a 3D scene.


[8]-----------------------------------
GopherSurfer, AppleSearch and GopherVR
--------------------------------------
An update on the popular Macintosh Gopher server software, how to integrate 
this software with the AppleSearch full-text search engine and how to make 
your GopherSurfer 3D-savvy.
 

[9]-------------------------------
Gopher gateway to Z39.50 and Isite
----------------------------------
Z39.50 servers are commonly used for library online catalogs, and there has 
been a Gopher gateway to Z39.50 catalogs for the last year. This session 
covers new developments in integrating Gopher with Z39.50 and Isite.


[10]----------------------
Integrating Gopher and WWW
--------------------------
HTMLJpages are a popular document format, while Gopher hierarchies are fast 
to navigate and let you associate abstracts, alternate views, and other 
meta information with any type of document. This session looks at how to 
publish HTMLJdocuments from Gopher servers and point Gopher links at 
HTMLJdocuments on WWW servers to serve the widest possible community and 
take advantage of the strengths for both Gopher and WWW. 


[11]----------------------------------------------------------
Using Gopher for Structured Searching of a Very Large Database
--------------------------------------------------------------
This session covers how to use FreeWais-SF and Gopher+ electronic forms
to publish and make searchable (by field) a very large database. Gopher+ 
forms make it possible to search on fields without exposing the user to 
FreeWAIS-SF syntax. The database published was the Books in Print 
database.
 

[12]-----------------------------------------------
Champagne Tastes on a Beer Budget
Linux as a Low Cost Option for a Gopher/HTTP Server
---------------------------------------------------
Steven Kirby <kirby@rhett.libs.uga.edu>

This session will discuss the University of Georgia Libraries' experience 
running a Gopher and HTTP server under the Linux operating system. Our 
server (gopher://scarlett.libs.uga.edu) has been in production for over a 
year and has served over a quarter of a million transaction without a hitch, 
despite the fact that the machine our Gopher server runs on is a lowly 
386DX-40 mhz system with 8 megabytes of memory and a 420 Mbyte IDE hard 
disk. This session will address a number of issues relating to running a 
Gopher server under Linux, including hardware options, obtaining and 
installing Linux, and selecting Gopher server software that is appropriate 
to a particular site's needs.  This session will be of interest to persons 
and organizations who prefer the stability and functionality of a 
Unix-based Gopher server, but whose budgets might not be able to 
accommodate a workstation or server to run a commercial variant of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
