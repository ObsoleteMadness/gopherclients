In this directory are subdirectories containing the current 
versions of internet Gopher clients and servers. 
Unfortunately, there is minimal documentation for the
software; but have faith, we are working on it.

The internet Gopher uses a simple client/server protocol
that can be used to publish and search for information held
on a distributed network of hosts. Gopher clients
have a seamless view of the information in the gopher 
world even though the information is distributed over many 
different hosts. Clients can either navigate through a 
hierarchy of directories and documents -or- ask an index
server to return a list of all documents that contain one 
or more words. Since the index server does full-text searches
every word in every document is a keyword.

If you want to test a gopher client without setting up
your own gopher server you should configure the client to
talk to "gopher.micro.umn.edu" at port 70. This will 
allow you to explore the distributed network of gopher
servers at the University of Minnesota. You can try the
Unix client by telneting to consultant.micro.umn.edu and
logging in as "gopher".

If you decide to run a gopher server and would like it to
appear in the list of "other gophers" at gopher.micro.umn.edu
send an e-mail to gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu and we will add
your gopher to the list of gophers.

Bug reports, comments, suggestions, etc. should be e-mailed to
the Gopher development team at:
