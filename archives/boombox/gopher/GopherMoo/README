Gopher MOO is a MUD that talks to gopherspace (acts as a gopher client).
It's the gopher client described in
     ftp://parcftp.xerox.com/pub/MOO/contrib/moogopher.ps

and was developed by Larry Masinter <masinter@parc.xerox.com> and 
Erik Ostrom. 

This is a general MOO interface to Gopher. To use it, you need a MOO
server. The MOO software is available from
<ftp://parcftp.xerox.com/pub/MOO/>. 

Gopher MOO was the gopher application that won the "coolest use of gopher"
contest at the Gopher Conference in Minneapolis in the spring of 1993.
