Announcing GODOT v 0.1
------------------------------

We're proud to announce the availability of GODOT (GopherVR Organized
Directories Of Titles). With GODOT you can visualize large collections of
titles in 3D navigatable scene.  

The GODOT software runs on your Unix Gopher server.  It uses a 
modified version of our Gopher to Z39.50 Version 2 gateway
(go4zgate 2.0) to retrieve bibliographic information from remote
library on-line catalogs. The titles are categorized, and virtual
worlds, based on an author's canon, are created. You navigate the
virtual worlds with a GopherVR client.



Why is this useful?

This is step 1 towards creating virtual reality based digital libraries. 
In the real world, when someone finds herself at the library ready to
research a topic she knows nothing of, what does she do? Well, she 
probably tries to locate a book, some book, any book, on the topic
she is interested in. She then looks at the books sitting on the
shelf next to the book he found - and from there tries to get a feel
for the scope of the topic she is researching. Once she has a general
understanding of the problem she proceeds to devise a strategy for
solving the problem at hand. 

GODOT puts the user in the middle of a VR library. It gives the user
the oppurtunity to grasp the magnitude of books available. GODOT
then provides the user with additional information by providing
visual indications about each book's relationship with each other. 



How can I try it out?

  You can navigating some worlds by connecting to the following URL.
