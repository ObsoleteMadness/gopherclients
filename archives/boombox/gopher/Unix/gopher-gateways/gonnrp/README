This is my first releace of gonnrp.  I am sure I forgot to explane
something here.  If you have trouble write me.

gonnrp is my rewritten version of gonntp that uses INN's fast xhdr
(because of overview) instead of tin's xindex.

gonnrp breaks newsgroups down into menus at each '.'.
Example:

                  Internet Gopher Information Client v1.12-ecn
 
                 clari - ClariNet UPI wireservice news (gonnrp)
 
 -->  1.  *** REQUIRED READING *** ClariNet Copyright Information ***.
      2.  biz - Business/
      3.  canada - Canadian Standard Broadcast Wire Service/
      4.  feature - /
      5.  local - Regional news/
      6.  nb - NewsBytes computer industry news service/
      7.  net - News and discussion about ClariNet/
      8.  news - /
      9.  sfbay - /
      10. sports - /
      11. streetprice - A group for prices of computer products.  (Moderated)/
      12. tw - TechWire, technology and topics related to technology/

This makes smaller more readable menus.

Other gonnrp features:

  o gonnrp understands newsgroups names with '_'s in them.

  o gonnrp reads a dbm version of the newsgroups file to put the
    purposes of the newsgroups in the menus.

You need the following files: (from uxa.ecn.bgu.edu:/pub/gopher/gonnrp)
README				(this file)
how_to_gonnrp			(what you need to know to use gonnrp)
gonnrp				(the program [in perl])
build-newsgroups-db		(builds the newsgroups dbm file)
dotall				(used by build-newsgroups-db)
