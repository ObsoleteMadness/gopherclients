March 1993.

There are two gopher-penninfo gateways:

       Gophtech: the gateway which allows Gopher clients to
access information in PennInfo (TechInfo) server.

       Techinpher: the gateway which allows PennInfo
(TechInfo) clients to access information in GopherSpace.

Both have been developed and run on the Ultrix operating
system; portability to other systems is uknown.

The techinpher gateway has exited unexpectedly on a number of
occasions, so I consider it to still be beta (if not alpha).
If you've never built, installed & run the TechInfo server
(the software from MIT), you probably will find the
techinpher gateway to be very cryptic.

Please read the copyright information carefully.  Some of the
modules for the techinpher gateway are copyrighed by MIT
(based on version 3.1 of their code).

Report bugs, bug fixes, enhancements, missing modules, and so
forth to penninfo-gopher@dccs.upenn.edu.
