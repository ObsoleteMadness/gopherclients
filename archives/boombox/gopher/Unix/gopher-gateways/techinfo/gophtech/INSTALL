********** How to install the gopher-techinfo gateway **********

1) Edit the file "gw.h" and change any #defines that need to
   be changed.

   DEBUGLOG		the filename where the gateway will write
			debugging and statistics information.  The
			gateway runs as userid "daemon", so make sure
			daemon has write permission on this file.  If
			necessary, create an empty file and change
			owner to daemon.

   MSGFILE		the filename of the "About this Gopher" item.
			The gateway will read this file and send it to
			the Gopher client.  See the file "MSG" for an
			example.  DAEMON needs read permission for
			this file.

   LOCALTI_SERVER	the domain name of the local Techinfo server
			The gateway connects to this server when a
			gopher sends "" as the token.  At UPENN, the
			name is penninfo-srv.upenn.edu.

			if there's no local TechInfo, change this line to:
#define LOCALTI_SERVER ""  /* there is no local techinfo */

   LOCALTI_PORT		the port that the local TechInfo server
			listens at (ignored if LOCALTI_SERVER is "").

   LOCALTI_MAINMENU	the nodeid of the top menu of the local
			Techinfo server (ignored if LOCALTI_SERVER is
			"").  You can pick any menu's nodeid.


   TISERVERS_HOST	the domain name of the host that knows the
			list of TechInfo servers.

   TISERVERS_PORT	the port at which the TISERVERS_HOST server
			listens.

   LOCALGOPHTITLE	the name(title) of a gopher server.  If
			you don't want to point to any, set it to
			"".  If you leave it blank, then
			LOCALGOPHERSERVER, LOCALGOPHERPORT, and
			LOCALGOPHERPATH are ignored.  Otherwise,
			the gateway sends them along with the
			title as part of the root menu.  The
			local gopher file type must be a Gopher
			Directory file (gopher type 1).  For the
			local gopher server at UPENN, these three
			values should be "gopher.upenn.edu", port
			"70", and "".

   WAIS			#define this flag if you want each menu
			to contain an item for full text wais
			searching.

   SOURCES_MSGFILE	Name of file that describes how to view the
			Gopher path & use it to see the TechInfo Source.

   SOURCES_NODEID	Nodeid of the TechInfo document at LOCALTI_SERVER.
			Ignored if there is no LOCALTI_SERVER.


 
2) Compile the gateway code:
	make -k

3) Move the executable to /usr/local/bin or whatever is the convention
   on your operating system.

4) Edit /etc/services and add the gopher service to it, if it's not
   already there:
gophtech	71/tcp

5) Edit /etc/inetd.conf and add the gophtech gateway to it.  The
   gateway program takes two arguments: the domain name of the
   localhost, and the port at which the gateway is listening.

Example:

gophtech stream tcp nowait /usr/local/bin/gophtech gophtech gopher-penninfo.upenn.edu gophtech

6) Send a HUP to the inetd daemon so that it will re-read inetd.conf.

7) Copy MSG and PROVIDERS to the right directory.

   Give DAEMON the permission to read these files, since the gateway
   runs as userid DAEMON.  chmod ugo+r .../{MSG,PROVIDERS}

8) Define the domain name (or a CNAME) in the domain name system for
   your site.  In the example I used above, it would be
   gopher-penninfo.upenn.edu.

9) The MSG file refers to a mail alias to report bugs with
   the gophtech gateway (gopher-penninfo@dccs.upenn.edu).  Please
   create the mail alias and be sure that at least murphy@dccs.upenn.edu
   is on the list.  I don't know who, if anyone else, should be on
   it.
