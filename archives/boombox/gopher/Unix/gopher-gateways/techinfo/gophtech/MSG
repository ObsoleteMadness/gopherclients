                 About PennInfo via the Gopher Gateway
                 =====================================

PennInfo is the online campus-wide information system of the University 
of Pennsylvania.  PennInfo is based on the TechInfo software developed 
at MIT  

Gopher access to PennInfo is provided by the Penn developed Gopher-to-
PennInfo gateway.  This gateway enables viewing PennInfo documents via 
the Gopher user interface and command set.  Through the gateway you can 
access other campus information systems that are based on the TechInfo 
software.

Some features of PennInfo are not available in the Gopher command set.  
If you want access to the full PennInfo command set exit the Gopher
system and then:

  1. Telnet to:

     penninfo.upenn.edu           or,

  2. Obtain the PennInfo TCP/IP Macintosh software, select 'Network
     Preferences' from the pull-down file menu, and fill in two dialog
     boxes:
       
               Server: penninfo-srv.upenn.edu
               Port: 9000

     The Mac TCP/IP software is available at ftp.upenn.edu in the 
     pub/penninfo directory.

If you are interested in more detailed information about the differences 
between the Gopher and PennInfo command sets, please refer to the other 
documents in this folder.

This gateway is supported by Data Communications and Computing Services 
(DCCS) at the University of Pennsylvania.  If you wish to report a
