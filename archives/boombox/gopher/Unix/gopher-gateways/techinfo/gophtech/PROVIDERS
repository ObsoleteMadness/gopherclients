                 Document Responsibility in PennInfo
                 ===================================

There are over 70 providers of information in PennInfo.  Each provider 
is responsible for the information they contribute.  Users of PennInfo 
are accustomed to being able to identify who is responsible for any 
topic on any menu in PennInfo through the use of a 'Get Info' option.  
This functionality is not natively available in Gopher software at 
this time.  

An alternative mechanism has been created by Data Communications
and Computing Services (DCCS) to allow Gopher users to identify
which organization at the University of Pennsylvania is responsible
for PennInfo information:


Step 1
======
Use your gopher client to request information about the PennInfo topic.  
Use whatever mechanism is provided by your application to get this 
information.


Step 2
======
Look at the 'Path' information and note the last word in the path.  The 
last word in the path is the organization responsible for the PennInfo 
information (known as a 'Source'). For example, the Unix gopher client 
displays the following information about a topic on a menu called 
'PennInfo Version 3.9 Available':

     Name=PennInfo Version 3.9 Available
     Type=0
     Port=71
     Path=D penninfo-srv.upenn.edu 9000 8615 Admin
                                             ^^^^^
Notice that the last word in the 'Path' is 'Admin.'  This means that 
'Admin' is the organization that contributed the information -- the 
'Source'.


Step 3
======
Now that you have the name of 'Source,' you can search the document 
'Providers of Information (Sources) List' to retrieve the contact name,
phone number, and an electronic mail address associated with your
'Source.'

* Note: the 'Providers of Information (Sources) List' appears at the
bottom of all PennInfo menus (merged with this instructional document) 
that are displayed via the Gopher gateway.
