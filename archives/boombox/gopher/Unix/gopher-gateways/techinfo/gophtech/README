	 Gateway from Internet Gophers  to TechInfo Services

   This is a one way gateway from gopher protocol to TI protocol:
   gopher client connects to this server and makes a request, this
   program connects to a TechInfo server and gets the appropriate
   information, sends the response to the client, and then closes 
   the connection.
