This is a prerelease version of xvgopher 1.0
I make these executables available to get feedback on the interface.
The sources are not ready for release, yet; I am still working on it.

Known problems with this prerelease are:

	- No bookmarks!  This is next on the list of things to fix.
	- The cut and paste in the action preferences do not work.
	- The directory filter doesn't filter on dates or types, yet.

There are two statically linked executables for the SunOS 4.X environment.

	- xvgopher.static.NIS
	  This one is linked with the standard Sun NIS library.  Use this if
	  you do not have a /etc/resolv.conf
	- xvgopher.static.resolver
	  This one is linked with libresolv.a.  Use this if you DO have
	  /etc/resolv.conf

Both programs will try to contact a local host named 'gopher' at port 70.
You can change this on the command line.

If you have any problems with either of these executables, let me know and
I'll try to fix it.

Please send problems, suggestions, etc. to Andrew@SDSU.Edu
